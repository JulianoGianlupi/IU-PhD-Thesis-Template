	abstract = {Simulations of tissue-specific effects of primary acute viral infections like COVID-19 are essential for understanding disease outcomes and optimizing therapies. Such simulations need to support continuous updating in response to rapid advances in understanding of infection mechanisms, and parallel development of components by multiple groups. We present an open-source platform for multiscale spatiotemporal simulation of an epithelial tissue, viral infection, cellular immune response and tissue damage, specifically designed to be modular and extensible to support continuous updating and parallel development. The base simulation of a simplified patch of epithelial tissue and immune response exhibits distinct patterns of infection dynamics from widespread infection, to recurrence, to clearance. Slower viral internalization and faster immune-cell recruitment slow infection and promote containment. Because antiviral drugs can have side effects and show reduced clinical effectiveness when given later during infection, we studied the effects on progression of treatment potency and time-of-first treatment after infection. In simulations, even a low potency therapy with a drug which reduces the replication rate of viral RNA greatly decreases the total tissue damage and virus burden when given near the beginning of infection. Many combinations of dosage and treatment time lead to stochastic outcomes, with some simulation replicas showing clearance or control (treatment success), while others show rapid infection of all epithelial cells (treatment failure). Thus, while a high potency therapy usually is less effective when given later, treatments at late times are occasionally effective. We illustrate how to extend the platform to model specific virus types (e.g., hepatitis C) and add additional cellular mechanisms (tissue recovery and variable cell susceptibility to infection), using our software modules and publicly-available software repository.},

We model remdesivir treatment for COVID-19; however, our methods are general to other viral infections and antiviral therapies. We investigate the effects of drug potency, drug dosing frequency, treatment initiation delay, antiviral half-life, and variability in cellular uptake and metabolism of remdesivir and its active metabolite on treatment outcomes in a simulated patch of infected epithelial tissue. Non-spatial deterministic population models which treat all cells of a given class as identical can clarify how treatment dosage and timing influence treatment efficacy. However, they do not reveal how cell-to-cell variability affects treatment outcomes. Our simulations suggest that for a given treatment regime, including cell-to-cell variation in drug uptake, permeability and metabolism increase the likelihood of uncontrolled infection as the cells with the lowest internal levels of antiviral act as super-spreaders within the tissue. The model predicts substantial variability in infection outcomes between similar tissue patches for different treatment options. In models with cellular metabolic variability, antiviral doses have to be increased significantly ({\textgreater}50\% depending on simulation parameters) to achieve the same treatment results as with the homogeneous cellular metabolism.},

	abstract = {The 2019 novel coronavirus, SARS-CoV-2, is a pathogen of critical significance to international public health. Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable “choke points” for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving regular refinements. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health. More broadly, this effort is creating a reusable, modular framework for studying viral replication and immune response in tissues, which can also potentially be adapted to related problems in immunology and immunotherapy.},

Significantly in many developing countries, limited medical resources and excess population seriously affect the diagnosis and treatment of alung cancer patients. The 21st century is an era of life medicine, big data, and information technology. Synthetic biology is known as the driving force of natural product innovation and research in this era. Based on the research of NSCLC targeted drugs, through the cross-fusion of synthetic biology and artificial intelligence, using the idea of bioengineering, we construct an artificial intelligence assisted medical system and propose a drug selection framework for the personalized selection of NSCLC patients. Under the premise of ensuring the efficacy, considering the economic cost of targeted drugs as an auxiliary decision-making factor, the system predicts the drug effectiveness-cost then. The experiment shows that our method can rely on the provided clinical data to screen drug treatment programs suitable for the patient's conditions and assist doctors in making an efficient diagnosis.},

We suggest means of artificial intelligence to individually predict AMD progression.    In eyes with intermediate AMD, progression to the neovascular type with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) or the dry type with geographic atrophy (GA) was diagnosed based on standardized monthly optical coherence tomography (OCT) images by independent graders. We obtained automated volumetric segmentation of outer neurosensory layers and retinal pigment epithelium, drusen, and hyperreflective foci by spectral domain-OCT image analysis. Using imaging, demographic, and genetic input features, we developed and validated a machine learning–based predictive model assessing the risk of conversion to advanced AMD.    Of a total of 495 eyes, 159 eyes (32\%) had converted to advanced AMD within 2 years, 114 eyes progressed to CNV, and 45 to GA. Our predictive model differentiated converting versus nonconverting eyes with a performance of 0.68 and 0.80 for CNV and GA, respectively. The most critical quantitative features for progression were outer retinal thickness, hyperreflective foci, and drusen area. The features for conversion showed pathognomonic patterns that were distinctly different for the neovascular and the atrophic pathways. Predictive hallmarks for CNV were mostly drusen-centric, while GA markers were associated with neurosensory retina and age.    Artificial intelligence with automated analysis of imaging biomarkers allows personalized prediction of AMD progression. Moreover, pathways of progression may be specific in respect to the neovascular/atrophic type.},

Patients with confirmed COVID-19 infection and initially of non-severe type were retrospectively included. The initial CT scan on admission was used for imaging analysis. The presence of ground glass opacity (GGO), consolidation and other findings were visually evaluated. CT severity score was calculated according to the extent of lesion involvement. In addition, AI based quantification of GGO and consolidation volume were also performed. 123 patients (mean age: 64.43 ± 14.02; 62 males) were included. GGO + consolidation was more frequently revealed in progress-to-severe group whereas pure GGO was more likely to be found in non-severe group. Compared to non-severe group, patients in progress-to-severe group had larger GGO volume (167.33 ± 167.88 cm3 versus 101.12 ± 127 cm3, p = 0.013) as well as consolidation volume (40.85 ± 60.4 cm3 versus 6.63 ± 14.91 cm3, p {\textless} 0.001). Among imaging parameters, consolidation volume had the largest area under curve (AUC) in discriminating non-severe from progress-to-severe group (AUC = 0.796, p {\textless} 0.001) and patients with or without critical events (AUC = 0.754, p {\textless} 0.001). According to multivariate regression, consolidation volume and age were two strongest predictors for disease progression (hazard ratio: 1.053 and 1.071, p: 0.006 and 0.008) whereas age and diabetes were predictors for unfavorable outcome. Consolidation volume quantified on initial chest CT was the strongest predictor for disease severity progression and larger consolidation volume was associated with unfavorable clinical outcome.},

In our experiment, the model that incorporates the highest degree of nonlinearity (Gaussian Kernel) had the best in-sample performance, but also yielded the worst out-of-sample predictions, a typical example of overfitting in a machine learning model. On the other hand, the linear Kernel function performed badly in-sample but generated the best out-of-sample forecasts.

	abstract = {Explainable artificial intelligence (AI) is attracting much interest in medicine. Technically, the problem of explainability is as old as AI itself and classic AI represented comprehensible retraceable approaches. However, their weakness was in dealing with uncertainties of the real world. Through the introduction of probabilistic learning, applications became increasingly successful, but increasingly opaque. Explainable AI deals with the implementation of transparency and traceability of statistical black-box machine learning methods, particularly deep learning (DL). We argue that there is a need to go beyond explainable AI. To reach a level of explainable medicine we need causability. In the same way that usability encompasses measurements for the quality of use, causability encompasses measurements for the quality of explanations. In this article, we provide some necessary definitions to discriminate between explainability and causability as well as a use-case of DL interpretation and of human explanation in histopathology. The main contribution of this article is the notion of causability, which is differentiated from explainability in that causability is a property of a person, while explainability is a property of a system This article is categorized under: Fundamental Concepts of Data and Knowledge {\textgreater} Human Centricity and User Interaction},

Mathematical biology seeks to explain biophysical processes in mathematical terms at, and across, all relevant spatial and temporal scales, through the generation of representative models. While non-spatial, ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often used and readily calibrated to experimental data, they do not explicitly represent the spatial and stochastic features of a biological system, limiting their insights and applications. However, spatial models describing biological systems with spatial information are mathematically complex and computationally expensive, which limits the ability to calibrate and deploy them and highlights the need for simpler methods able to model the spatial features of biological systems.},

	abstract = {Many multicellular systems problems can only be understood by studying how cells move, grow, divide, interact, and die. Tissue-scale dynamics emerge from systems of many interacting cells as they respond to and influence their microenvironment. The ideal "virtual laboratory" for such multicellular systems simulates both the biochemical microenvironment (the "stage") and many mechanically and biochemically interacting cells (the "players" upon the stage). PhysiCell-physics-based multicellular simulator-is an open source agent-based simulator that provides both the stage and the players for studying many interacting cells in dynamic tissue microenvironments. It builds upon a multi-substrate biotransport solver to link cell phenotype to multiple diffusing substrates and signaling factors. It includes biologically-driven sub-models for cell cycling, apoptosis, necrosis, solid and fluid volume changes, mechanics, and motility "out of the box." The C++ code has minimal dependencies, making it simple to maintain and deploy across platforms. PhysiCell has been parallelized with OpenMP, and its performance scales linearly with the number of cells. Simulations up to 105-106 cells are feasible on quad-core desktop workstations; larger simulations are attainable on single HPC compute nodes. We demonstrate PhysiCell by simulating the impact of necrotic core biomechanics, 3-D geometry, and stochasticity on the dynamics of hanging drop tumor spheroids and ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) of the breast. We demonstrate stochastic motility, chemical and contact-based interaction of multiple cell types, and the extensibility of PhysiCell with examples in synthetic multicellular systems (a "cellular cargo delivery" system, with application to anti-cancer treatments), cancer heterogeneity, and cancer immunology. PhysiCell is a powerful multicellular systems simulator that will be continually improved with new capabilities and performance improvements. It also represents a significant independent code base for replicating results from other simulation platforms. The PhysiCell source code, examples, documentation, and support are available under the BSD license at http://PhysiCell.MathCancer.org and http://PhysiCell.sf.net.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Corticosteroid therapy is used commonly in patients with COVID-19, although its impact on outcomes and which patients could benefit from corticosteroid therapy are uncertain.
RESEARCH QUESTION: Are clinical phenotypes of COVID-19 associated with differential response to corticosteroid therapy?
STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: Critically ill patients with COVID-19 from Tongji Hospital treated between January and February 2020 were included, and the main exposure of interest was the administration of IV corticosteroids. The primary outcome was 28-day mortality. Marginal structural modeling was used to account for baseline and time-dependent confounders. An unsupervised machine learning approach was carried out to identify phenotypes of COVID-19.
RESULTS: A total of 428 patients were included; 280 of 428 patients (65.4\%) received corticosteroid therapy. The 28-day mortality was significantly higher in patients who received corticosteroid therapy than in those who did not (53.9\% vs 19.6\%; P {\textless} .0001). After marginal structural modeling, corticosteroid therapy was not associated significantly with 28-day mortality (hazard ratio [HR], 0.80; 95\% CI, 0.54-1.18; P = .26). Our analysis identified two phenotypes of COVID-19, and compared with the hypoinflammatory phenotype, the hyperinflammatory phenotype was characterized by elevated levels of proinflammatory cytokines, higher Sequential Organ Failure Assessment scores, and higher rates of complications. Corticosteroid therapy was associated with a reduced 28-day mortality (HR, 0.45; 95\% CI, 0.25-0.80; P = .0062) in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype.
INTERPRETATION: For critically ill patients with COVID-19, corticosteroid therapy was not associated with 28-day mortality, but the use of corticosteroids showed significant survival benefits in patients with the hyperinflammatory phenotype.},

The date of final follow-up was May 20, 2020.Patients were randomized in a 1:1:1 ratio to receive a 10-day course of remdesivir (n = 197), a 5-day course of remdesivir (n = 199), or standard care (n = 200). Remdesivir was dosed intravenously at 200 mg on day 1 followed by 100 mg/d.The primary end point was clinical status on day 11 on a 7-point ordinal scale ranging from death (category 1) to discharged (category 7). Differences between remdesivir treatment groups and standard care were calculated using proportional odds models and expressed as odds ratios. An odds ratio greater than 1 indicates difference in clinical status distribution toward category 7 for the remdesivir group vs the standard care group.Among 596 patients who were randomized, 584 began the study and received remdesivir or continued standard care (median age, 57 [interquartile range, 46-66] years; 227 [39\%] women; 56\% had cardiovascular disease, 42\% hypertension, and 40\% diabetes), and 533 (91\%) completed the trial. Median length of treatment was 5 days for patients in the 5-day remdesivir group and 6 days for patients in the 10-day remdesivir group. On day 11, patients in the 5-day remdesivir group had statistically significantly higher odds of a better clinical status distribution than those receiving standard care (odds ratio, 1.65; 95\% CI, 1.09-2.48; P = .02). The clinical status distribution on day 11 between the 10-day remdesivir and standard care groups was not significantly different (P = .18 by Wilcoxon rank sum test). By day 28, 9 patients had died: 2 (1\%) in the 5-day remdesivir group, 3 (2\%) in the 10-day remdesivir group, and 4 (2\%) in the standard care group. Nausea (10\% vs 3\%), hypokalemia (6\% vs 2\%), and headache (5\% vs 3\%) were more frequent among remdesivir-treated patients compared with standard care.Among patients with moderate COVID-19, those randomized to a 10-day course of remdesivir did not have a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care at 11 days after initiation of treatment. Patients randomized to a 5-day course of remdesivir had a statistically significant difference in clinical status compared with standard care, but the difference was of uncertain clinical importance.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04292730},

	abstract = {Herpes simplex virus-2 infection is characterized by frequent episodic shedding in the genital tract. Expansion in HSV-2 viral load early during episodes is extremely rapid. However, the virus invariably peaks within 18 hours and is eliminated nearly as quickly. A critical feature of HSV-2 shedding episodes is their heterogeneity. Some episodes peak at 108 HSV DNA copies, last for weeks due to frequent viral re-expansion, and lead to painful ulcers, while others only reach 103 HSV DNA copies and are eliminated within hours and without symptoms. Within single micro-environments of infection, tissue-resident CD8+ T cells (TRM) appear to contain infection within a few days. Here, we review components of TRM biology relevant to immune surveillance between HSV-2 shedding episodes and containment of infection upon detection of HSV-2 cognate antigen. We then describe the use of mathematical models to correlate large spatial gradients in TRM density with the heterogeneity of observed shedding within a single person. We describe how models have been leveraged for clinical trial simulation, as well as future plans to model the interactions of multiple cellular subtypes within mucosa, predict the mechanism of action of therapeutic vaccines, and describe the dynamics of 3-dimensional infection environment during the natural evolution of an HSV-2 lesion.},

We evaluate the sensitivity of the model to biologically relevant parameters governing the strength and efficacy of the immune response. We also simulate the effect of both anti-inflammatory and antiviral drugs on the host immune response and demonstrate the ability of the model to lessen the severity of a formerly lethal infection with the addition of the appropriately calibrated drug.

	abstract = {Tumor growth curves are classically modeled by means of ordinary differential equations. In analyzing the Gompertz model several studies have reported a striking correlation between the two parameters of the model, which could be used to reduce the dimensionality and improve predictive power. We analyzed tumor growth kinetics within the statistical framework of nonlinear mixed-effects (population approach). This allowed the simultaneous modeling of tumor dynamics and inter-animal variability. Experimental data comprised three animal models of breast and lung cancers, with 833 measurements in 94 animals. Candidate models of tumor growth included the exponential, logistic and Gompertz models. The exponential and—more notably—logistic models failed to describe the experimental data whereas the Gompertz model generated very good fits. The previously reported population-level correlation between the Gompertz parameters was further confirmed in our analysis (R2 {\textgreater} 0.92 in all groups). Combining this structural correlation with rigorous population parameter estimation, we propose a reduced Gompertz function consisting of a single individual parameter (and one population parameter). Leveraging the population approach using Bayesian inference, we estimated times of tumor initiation using three late measurement timepoints. The reduced Gompertz model was found to exhibit the best results, with drastic improvements when using Bayesian inference as compared to likelihood maximization alone, for both accuracy and precision. Specifically, mean accuracy (prediction error) was 12.2\% versus 78\% and mean precision (width of the 95\% prediction interval) was 15.6 days versus 210 days, for the breast cancer cell line. These results demonstrate the superior predictive power of the reduced Gompertz model, especially when combined with Bayesian estimation. They offer possible clinical perspectives for personalized prediction of the age of a tumor from limited data at diagnosis.

	doi = {10.3851/IMP3309},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Pre-cART (combined antiretroviral therapy) plasma viral load {\textgreater}500,000 copies/ml has been associated with a lower probability of achieving virological suppression, while few data about its role on maintenance of virological suppression are available. In this study we aimed to clarify whether high levels of pre-cART viraemia are associated with virological rebound (VR) after virological suppression.
METHODS: HIV-infected individuals who achieved virological suppression after first-line cART were included. VR was defined as the first of two consecutive viraemia {\textgreater}50 copies/ml (VR50) or, in an alternative analysis, {\textgreater}200 copies/ml (VR200). The impact of pre-cART viraemia on the risk of VR was evaluated by survival analyses.
RESULTS: Among 5,766 patients included, 59.2\%, 31.4\%, 5.2\% and 4.2\% had pre-cART viraemia ≤100,000, 100,001-500,000, 500,001-1,000,000 and {\textgreater}1,000,000 copies/ml, respectively. Patients with pre-cART viraemia levels {\textgreater}1,000,000 copies/ml had the highest probability of VR ({\textgreater}1,000,000; 500,000-1,000,000; 100,000-500,000; {\textless}100,000 copies/ml; VR50: 28.4\%; 24.3\%; 17.6\%; 13.8\%, P{\textless}0.0001; VR200: 14.4\%; 11.1\%; 7.2\%; 7.6\%; P=0.009). By Cox multivariable analyses, patients with pre-cART viraemia {\textgreater}500,000 and {\textgreater}1,000,000 copies/ml showed a significantly higher risk of VR regardless of the VR end point used. No difference in the risk of VR was found between patients with pre-cART viraemia ranging 500,000-1,000,000 copies/ml and those with pre-cART viraemia {\textgreater}1,000,000 copies/ml, regardless of the VR end point used.
CONCLUSIONS: Pre-cART plasma viral load levels {\textgreater}500,000 copies/ml can identify fragile patients with poorer chance of maintaining virological control after an initial response.

The infectivity and pathogenicity of hepadnaviruses propagating in lymphoid cells are under debate. In this study, hepato- and lymphotropism of WHV produced by naturally infected lymphoid cells was examined in specifically established woodchuck hepatocyte and lymphoid cell cultures and coculture systems, and virus pathogenicity was tested in susceptible animals. Applying PCR-based assays discriminating between the total pool of WHV genomes and covalently closed circular DNA (cccDNA), combined with enzymatic elimination of extracellular viral sequences potentially associated with the cell surface, our study documents that virus replicating in woodchuck lymphoid cells is infectious to homologous hepatocytes and lymphoid cells in vitro. The productive replication of WHV from lymphoid cells in cultured hepatocytes was evidenced by the appearance of virus-specific DNA, cccDNA, and antigens, transmissibility of the virus through multiple passages in hepatocyte cultures, and the ability of the passaged virus to infect virus-naive animals. The data also revealed that WHV from lymphoid cells can initiate classical acute viral hepatitis in susceptible animals, albeit small quantities (approximately 10(3) virions) caused immunovirologically undetectable (occult) WHV infection that engaged the lymphatic system but not the liver. Our results provide direct in vitro and in vivo evidence that lymphoid cells in the infected host support propagation of infectious hepadnavirus that has the potential to induce hepatitis. They also emphasize a principal role of the lymphatic system in the maintenance and dissemination of hepadnavirus infection, particularly when infection is induced by low virus doses.},

	abstract = {The SARS-CoV-2 virus is highly contagious, as demonstrated by numerous well-documented superspreading events. The infection commonly starts in the upper respiratory tract (URT) but can migrate to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) and other organs, often with severe consequences. Whereas LRT infection can lead to shedding of virus via breath and cough droplets, URT infection enables shedding via abundant speech droplets. Their viral load can be high in carriers with mild or no symptoms, an observation linked to the abundance of SARS-CoV-2-susceptible cells in the oral cavity epithelium. Expelled droplets rapidly lose water through evaporation, with the smaller ones transforming into long-lived aerosol. Although the largest speech droplets can carry more virions, they are few in number, fall to the ground rapidly and therefore play a relatively minor role in transmission. Of more concern is small speech aerosol, which can descend deep into the LRT and cause severe disease. However, since their total volume is small, the amount of virus they carry is low. Nevertheless, in closed environments with inadequate ventilation, they can accumulate, which elevates the risk of direct LRT infection. Of most concern is the large fraction of speech aerosol that is intermediate-sized because it remains suspended in air for minutes and can be transported over considerable distances by convective air currents. The abundance of this speech-generated aerosol, combined with its high viral load in pre- and asymptomatic individuals, strongly implicates airborne transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through speech as the primary contributor to its rapid spread.},

	abstract = {Although the major mechanisms of aerosol deposition in the lung are known, detailed quantitative data in anatomically realistic models are still lacking, especially in the acinar airways. In this study, an algorithm was developed to build multigenerational three-dimensional models of alveolated airways with arbitrary bifurcation angles and spherical alveolar shape. Using computational fluid dynamics, the deposition of 1- and 3-μm aerosol particles was predicted in models of human alveolar sac and terminal acinar bifurcation under rhythmic wall motion for two breathing conditions (functional residual capacity = 3 liter, tidal volume = 0.5 and 0.9 liter, breathing period = 4 s). Particles entering the model during one inspiration period were tracked for multiple breathing cycles until all particles deposited or escaped from the model. Flow recirculation inside alveoli occurred only during transition between inspiration and expiration and accounted for no more than 1\% of the whole cycle. Weak flow irreversibility and convective transport were observed in both models. The average deposition efficiency was similar for both breathing conditions and for both models. Under normal gravity, total deposition was ∼33 and 75\%, of which ∼67 and 96\% occurred during the first cycle, for 1- and 3-μm particles, respectively. Under zero gravity, total deposition was ∼2–5\% for both particle sizes. These results support previous findings that gravitational sedimentation is the dominant deposition mechanism for micrometer-sized aerosols in acinar airways. The results also showed that moving walls and multiple breathing cycles are needed for accurate estimation of aerosol deposition in acinar airways.},

	abstract = {Multicellular aggregate growth is regulated by nutrient availability and removal of metabolites, but the specifics of growth dynamics are dependent on cell type and environment. Classical models of growth are based on differential equations. While in some cases these classical models match experimental observations, they can only predict growth of a limited number of cell types and so can only be selectively applied. Currently, no classical model provides a general mathematical representation of growth for any cell type and environment. This discrepancy limits their range of applications, which a general modelling framework can enhance. In this work, a hybrid cellular Potts model is used to explain the discrepancy between classical models as emergent behaviours from the same mathematical system. Intracellular processes are described using probability distributions of local chemical conditions for proliferation and death and simulated. By fitting simulation results to a generalization of the classical models, their emergence is demonstrated. Parameter variations elucidate how aggregate growth may behave like one classical growth model or another. Three classical growth model fits were tested, and emergence of the Gompertz equation was demonstrated. Effects of shape changes are demonstrated, which are significant for final aggregate size and growth rate, and occur stochastically.},

	abstract = {A novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome-coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) or coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), has caused a pandemic that continues to cause catastrophic health and economic carnage and has escalated the identification and development of antiviral agents. Remdesivir (RDV), a prodrug and requires intracellular conversions to the active triphosphate nucleoside (TN) has surfaced as an active anti-SARS-CoV-2 drug. To properly design therapeutic treatment regimens, it is imperative to determine if adequate intracellular TN concentrations are achieved in target tissues, such as the lungs. Because measurement of such concentrations is unrealistic in patients, a physiologically-based pharmacokinetic (PBPK) model was developed to characterize RDV and TN disposition. Specifically, a hybrid PBPK model was developed based on previously reported data in humans. The model represented each tissue as a two-compartment model—both extracellular and intracellular compartment wherein each intracellular compartment contained a comprehensive metabolic model to the ultimate active metabolite TN. Global sensitivity analyses and Monte-Carlo simulations were conducted to assess which parameters and how highly sensitive ones impacted peripheral blood mononuclear cells and intracellular lung TN profiles. Finally, clinical multiple-dose regimens indicated that minimum lung intracellular TN concentrations ranged from 9 uM to 4 uM, which suggest current regimens are effective based on in vitro half-maximal effective concentration values. The model can be used to explore tissue drug disposition under various conditions and regimens, and expanded to pharmacodynamic models.},

	abstract = {SARS-CoV-2 is a human pathogen that causes infection in both the upper respiratory tract (URT) and the lower respiratory tract (LRT). The viral kinetics of SARS-CoV-2 infection and how they relate to infectiousness and disease progression are not well understood. Here, we develop data-driven viral dynamic models of SARS-CoV-2 infection in both the URT and LRT. We fit the models to viral load data from patients with likely infection dates known, we estimated that infected individuals with a longer incubation period had lower rates of viral growth, took longer to reach peak viremia in the URT, and had higher chances of presymptomatic transmission. We then developed a model linking viral load to infectiousness. We found that to explain the substantial fraction of transmissions occurring presymptomatically, a person’s infectiousness should depend on a saturating function of the viral load, making the logarithm of the URT viral load a better surrogate of infectiousness than the viral load itself. Comparing the roles of target-cell limitation, the innate immune response, proliferation of target cells and spatial infection in the LRT, we found that spatial dissemination in the lungs is likely to be an important process in sustaining the prolonged high viral loads. Overall, our models provide a quantitative framework for predicting how SARS-CoV-2 within-host dynamics determine infectiousness and represent a step towards quantifying how viral load dynamics and the immune responses determine disease severity.},

Suboptimal (inadequate) exposure can produce amplification of resistant bacteria. This minireview provides an overview of published evidence supporting the positions that, in most situations, it is the exposure achieved during the first dose that is relevant for determining the therapeutic outcome of an infection, therapeutic intervention should be initiated as soon as possible to minimize the size of the bacterial burden at the infection site, and the duration of drug administration should be kept as brief as clinically appropriate to reduce the risk of selecting for resistant (or phenotypically nonresponsive) microbial strains. To support these recommendations, we briefly discuss data on inoculum effects, persister cells, and the concept of time within some defined mutation selection window.},

	abstract = {Recently, the advent of deep learning has spurred interest in the development of physics-informed neural networks (PINN) for efficiently solving partial differential equations (PDEs), particularly in a parametric setting. Among all different classes of deep neural networks, the convolutional neural network (CNN) has attracted increasing attention in the scientific machine learning community, since the parameter-sharing feature in CNN enables efficient learning for problems with large-scale spatiotemporal fields. However, one of the biggest challenges is that CNN only can handle regular geometries with image-like format (i.e., rectangular domains with uniform grids). In this paper, we propose a novel physics-constrained CNN learning architecture, aiming to learn solutions of parametric PDEs on irregular domains without any labeled data. In order to leverage powerful classic CNN backbones, elliptic coordinate mapping is introduced to enable coordinate transforms between the irregular physical domain and regular reference domain. The proposed method has been assessed by solving a number of steady-state PDEs on irregular domains, including heat equations, Navier-Stokes equations, and Poisson equations with parameterized boundary conditions, varying geometries, and spatially-varying source fields. Moreover, the proposed method has also been compared against the state-of-the-art PINN with fully-connected neural network (FC-NN) formulation. The numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and exhibit notable superiority over the FC-NN based PINN in terms of efficiency and accuracy.},

The resulting neural networks form a new class of data-eﬃcient universal function approximators that naturally encode any underlying physical laws as prior information. In this ﬁrst part, we demonstrate how these networks can be used to infer solutions to partial diﬀerential equations, and obtain physics-informed surrogate models that are fully diﬀerentiable with respect to all input coordinates and free parameters.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09684},
	abstract = {Solving heat transfer equations on chip becomes very critical in the upcoming 5G and AI chip-package-systems. However, batches of simulations have to be performed for data driven supervised machine learning models. Data driven methods are data hungry, to address this, Physics Informed Neural Networks (PINN) have been proposed. However, vanilla PINN models solve one fixed heat equation at a time, so the models have to be retrained for heat equations with different source terms. Additionally, issues related to multi-objective optimization have to be resolved while using PINN to minimize the PDE residual, satisfy boundary conditions and fit the observed data etc. Therefore, this paper investigates an unsupervised learning approach for solving heat transfer equations on chip without using solution data and generalizing the trained network for predicting solutions for heat equations with unseen source terms. Specifically, a hybrid framework of Auto Encoder (AE) and Image Gradient (IG) based network is designed. The AE is used to encode different source terms of the heat equations. The IG based network implements a second order central difference algorithm for structured grids and minimizes the PDE residual. The effectiveness of the designed network is evaluated by solving heat equations for various use cases. It is proved that with limited number of source terms to train the AE network, the framework can not only solve the given heat transfer problems with a single training process, but also make reasonable predictions for unseen cases (heat equations with new source terms) without retraining.},

	abstract = {High-dimensional PDEs have been a longstanding computational challenge. We propose to solve high-dimensional PDEs by approximating the solution with a deep neural network which is trained to satisfy the differential operator, initial condition, and boundary conditions. Our algorithm is meshfree, which is key since meshes become infeasible in higher dimensions. Instead of forming a mesh, the neural network is trained on batches of randomly sampled time and space points. The algorithm is tested on a class of high-dimensional free boundary PDEs, which we are able to accurately solve in up to \$200\$ dimensions. The algorithm is also tested on a high-dimensional Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman PDE and Burgers' equation. The deep learning algorithm approximates the general solution to the Burgers' equation for a continuum of different boundary conditions and physical conditions (which can be viewed as a high-dimensional space). We call the algorithm a "Deep Galerkin Method (DGM)" since it is similar in spirit to Galerkin methods, with the solution approximated by a neural network instead of a linear combination of basis functions. In addition, we prove a theorem regarding the approximation power of neural networks for a class of quasilinear parabolic PDEs.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have gained popularity across different engineering fields due to their effectiveness in solving realistic problems with noisy data and often partially missing physics. In PINNs, automatic differentiation is leveraged to evaluate differential operators without discretization errors, and a multitask learning problem is defined in order to simultaneously fit observed data while respecting the underlying governing laws of physics. Here, we present applications of PINNs to various prototype heat transfer problems, targeting in particular realistic conditions not readily tackled with traditional computational methods. To this end, we first consider forced and mixed convection with unknown thermal boundary conditions on the heated surfaces and aim to obtain the temperature and velocity fields everywhere in the domain, including the boundaries, given some sparse temperature measurements. We also consider the prototype Stefan problem for two-phase flow, aiming to infer the moving interface, the velocity and temperature fields everywhere as well as the different conductivities of a solid and a liquid phase, given a few temperature measurements inside the domain. Finally, we present some realistic industrial applications related to power electronics to highlight the practicality of PINNs as well as the effective use of neural networks in solving general heat transfer problems of industrial complexity. Taken together, the results presented herein demonstrate that PINNs not only can solve ill-posed problems, which are beyond the reach of traditional computational methods, but they can also bridge the gap between computational and experimental heat transfer.},

Based on Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) formalism, a computational model was developed for the in-host response to influenza A virus, merging inflammatory, innate, adaptive and humoral responses to virus and linking severity of infection, the inflammatory response, and mortality. The model was calibrated using dense cytokine and cell data from adult BALB/c mice infected with the H1N1 influenza strain A/PR/8/34 in sublethal and lethal doses. Uncertainty in model parameters and disease mechanisms was quantified using Bayesian inference and ensemble model methodology that generates probabilistic predictions of survival, defined as viral clearance and recovery of the respiratory epithelium. The ensemble recovers the expected relationship between magnitude of viral exposure and the duration of survival, and suggests mechanisms primarily responsible for survival, which could guide the development of immuno-modulatory interventions as adjuncts to current anti-viral treatments. The model is employed to extrapolate from available data survival curves for the population and their dependence on initial viral aliquot. In addition, the model allows us to illustrate the positive effect of controlled inflammation on influenza survival.},

	abstract = {Background
Patients with severe COVID-19 develop a life-threatening hyperinflammatory response to the virus. Interleukin (IL)-1 or IL-6 inhibitors have been used to treat this patient population, but the comparative effectiveness of these different strategies remains undetermined. We aimed to compare IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation.
Methods
This cohort study included patients admitted to San Raffaele Hospital (Milan, Italy) with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, defined as a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen to the fraction of inspired oxygen of 300 mm Hg or less, and hyperinflammation, defined as serum C-reactive protein concentration of 100 mg/L or more or ferritin concentration of 900 ng/mL or more. The primary endpoint was survival, and the secondary endpoint was a composite of death or mechanical ventilation (adverse clinical outcome). Multivariable Cox regression analysis was used to compare clinical outcomes of patients receiving IL-1 inhibition (anakinra) or IL-6 inhibition (tocilizumab or sarilumab) with those of patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, after accounting for baseline differences. All patients received standard care. Interaction tests were used to assess the probability of survival according to C-reactive protein or lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.
Findings
Of 392 patients included between Feb 25 and May 20, 2020, 275 did not receive interleukin inhibitors, 62 received the IL-1 inhibitor anakinra, and 55 received an IL-6 inhibitor (29 received tocilizumab and 26 received sarilumab). In the multivariable analysis, compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors, patients treated with IL-1 inhibition had a significantly reduced mortality risk (hazard ratio [HR] 0·450, 95\% CI 0·204–0·990, p=0·047), but those treated with IL-6 inhibition did not (0·900, 0·412–1·966; p=0·79). In the multivariable analysis, there was no difference in adverse clinical outcome risk in patients treated with IL-1 inhibition (HR 0·866, 95\% CI 0·482–1·553; p=0·63) or IL-6 inhibition (0·882, 0·452–1·722; p=0·71) relative to patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For increasing C-reactive protein concentrations, patients treated with IL-6 inhibition had a significantly reduced risk of mortality (HR 0·990, 95\% CI 0·981–0·999; p=0·031) and adverse clinical outcome (0·987, 0·979–0·995; p=0·0021) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors. For decreasing concentrations of serum lactate dehydrogenase, patients treated with an IL-1 inhibitor and patients treated with IL-6 inhibitors had a reduced risk of mortality; increasing concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase in patients receiving either interleukin inhibitor were associated with an increased risk of mortality (HR 1·009, 95\% CI 1·003–1·014, p=0·0011 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·006, 1·001–1·011, p=0·028 for IL-6 inhibitors) and adverse clinical outcome (1·006, 1·002–1·010, p=0·0031 for IL-1 inhibitors and 1·005, 1·001–1·010, p=0·016 for IL-6 inhibitors) compared with patients who did not receive interleukin inhibitors.
Interpretation
IL-1 inhibition, but not IL-6 inhibition, was associated with a significant reduction of mortality in patients admitted to hospital with COVID-19, respiratory insufficiency, and hyperinflammation. IL-6 inhibition was effective in a subgroup of patients with markedly high C-reactive protein concentrations, whereas both IL-1 and IL-6 inhibition were effective in patients with low lactate dehydrogenase concentrations.

The design of new treatments for TB is hindered by the large number of candidate drugs, drug combinations, dosing choices, and complex pharmaco-kinetics/dynamics (PK/PD). Here we study the interplay of these factors in designing combination therapies by linking a machine-learning model, INDIGO-MTB, which predicts in vitro drug interactions using drug transcriptomics, with a multi-scale model of drug PK/PD and pathogen-immune interactions called GranSim. We calculate an in vivo drug interaction score (iDIS) from dynamics of drug diffusion, spatial distribution, and activity within lesions against various pathogen sub-populations. The iDIS of drug regimens evaluated against non-replicating bacteria significantly correlates with efficacy metrics from clinical trials. Our approach identifies mechanisms that can amplify synergistic or mitigate antagonistic drug interactions in vivo by modulating the relative distribution of drugs. Our mechanistic framework enables efficient evaluation of in vivo drug interactions and optimization of combination therapies.},

We found that model-predicted virion production is fairly insensitive to changes in most viral entry, assembly, and release parameters, but highly sensitive to some viral transcription and translation parameters.

Knowledge of the interplay between molecular-scale virus-receptor interactions, single-cell viral replication, intracellular-scale viral transport, and emergent tissue-scale viral propagation is limited. Moreover, little is known about immune system-virus-tissue interactions and how these can result in low-level (asymptomatic) infections in some cases and acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) in others, particularly with respect to presentation in different age groups or pre-existing inflammatory risk factors like diabetes. Given the nonlinear interactions within and among each of these processes, multiscale simulation models can shed light on the emergent dynamics that lead to divergent outcomes, identify actionable “choke points” for pharmacologic interventions, screen potential therapies, and identify potential biomarkers that differentiate patient outcomes. Given the complexity of the problem and the acute need for an actionable model to guide therapy discovery and optimization, we introduce and iteratively refine a prototype of a multiscale model of SARS-CoV-2 dynamics in lung tissue. The first prototype model was built and shared internationally as open source code and an online interactive model in under 12 hours, and community domain expertise is driving rapid refinements with a two-to-four week release cycle. In a sustained community effort, this consortium is integrating data and expertise across virology, immunology, mathematical biology, quantitative systems physiology, cloud and high performance computing, and other domains to accelerate our response to this critical threat to international health.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {In many mechanistic medical, biological, physical and engineered spatiotemporal dynamic models the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs) can make simulations impractically slow. Biological models require the simultaneous calculation of the spatial variation of concentration of dozens of diffusing chemical species. Machine learning surrogates, neural networks trained to provide approximate solutions to such complicated numerical problems, can often provide speed-ups of several orders of magnitude compared to direct calculation. PDE surrogates enable use of larger models than are possible with direct calculation and can make including such simulations in real-time or near-real time workflows practical. Creating a surrogate requires running the direct calculation tens of thousands of times to generate training data and then training the neural network, both of which are computationally expensive. We use a Convolutional Neural Network to approximate the stationary solution to the diffusion equation in the case of two equal-diameter, circular, constant-value sources located at random positions in a two-dimensional square domain with absorbing boundary conditions. To improve convergence during training, we apply a training approach that uses roll-back to reject stochastic changes to the network that increase the loss function. The trained neural network approximation is about 1e3 times faster than the direct calculation for individual replicas. Because different applications will have different criteria for acceptable approximation accuracy, we discuss a variety of loss functions and accuracy estimators that can help select the best network for a particular application.},

	abstract = {Conventional methods of 3D object generative modeling learn volumetric predictions using deep networks with 3D convolutional operations, which are direct analogies to classical 2D ones. However, these methods are computationally wasteful in attempt to predict 3D shapes, where information is rich only on the surfaces. In this paper, we propose a novel 3D generative modeling framework to efﬁciently generate object shapes in the form of dense point clouds. We use 2D convolutional operations to predict the 3D structure from multiple viewpoints and jointly apply geometric reasoning with 2D projection optimization. We introduce the pseudorenderer, a differentiable module to approximate the true rendering operation, to synthesize novel depth maps for optimization. Experimental results for singleimage 3D object reconstruction tasks show that we outperforms state-of-the-art methods in terms of shape similarity and prediction density.},

Our results indicate that virtual patients with low production rates of infected cell derived IFN subsequently experienced highly inflammatory disease phenotypes, compared to those with early and robust IFN responses. In these \textit{in silico} patients, the maximum concentration of IL-6 was also a major predictor of CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$ T cell depletion. Our analyses predicted that individuals with severe COVID-19 also have accelerated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation that was mediated by increased IL-6 and reduced type I IFN signalling. Together, these findings identify biomarkers driving the development of severe COVID-19 and support early interventions aimed at reducing inflammation.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Author summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Understanding of how the immune system responds to SARS-CoV-2 infections is critical for improving diagnostic and treatment approaches.

To study the drivers of severe COVID-19, we used our model to expand a cohort of virtual patients, each with realistic disease dynamics.

	abstract = {The current influenza vaccine provides narrow protection against the strains included in the vaccine, and needs to be reformulated every few years in response to the constantly evolving new strains. Novel approaches are directed towards developing vaccines that provide broader protection by targeting B and T cell epitopes that are conserved between different strains of the virus. In this paper, we focus on developing mathematical models to explore the CD8 T cell responses to influenza, how they can be boosted, and the conditions under which they contribute to protection. Our models suggest that the interplay between spatial heterogeneity (with the virus infecting the respiratory tract and the immune response being generated in the secondary lymphoid organs) and T cell differentiation (with proliferation occurring in the lymphoid organs giving rise to a subpopulation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract) is the key to understanding the dynamics of protection afforded by the CD8 T cell response to influenza. Our results suggest that the time lag for the generation of resident T cells in the respiratory tract and their rate of decay following infection are the key factors that limit the efficacy of CD8 T cell responses. The models predict that an increase in the level of central memory T cells leads to a gradual decrease in the viral load, and, in contrast, there is a sharper protection threshold for the relationship between the size of the population of resident T cells and protection. The models also suggest that repeated natural influenza infections cause the number of central memory CD8 T cells and the peak number of resident memory CD8 T cells to reach their plateaus, and while the former is maintained the latter decays with time since the most recent infection.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Mathematical and computational modeling have a long history of uncovering mechanisms and making predictions for biological systems. However, to create a model that can provide relevant quantitative predictions, models must first be calibrated by recapitulating existing biological datasets from that system. Current calibration approaches may not be appropriate for complex biological models because: 1) many attempt to recapitulate only a single aspect of the experimental data (such as a median trend) or 2) Bayesian techniques require specification of parameter priors and likelihoods to experimental data that cannot always be confidently assigned. A new calibration protocol is needed to calibrate complex models when current approaches fall short.
Methods: Herein, we develop CaliPro, an iterative, model-agnostic calibration protocol that utilizes parameter density estimation to refine parameter space and calibrate to temporal biological datasets. An important aspect of CaliPro is the user-defined pass set definition, which specifies how the model might successfully recapitulate experimental data. We define the appropriate settings to use CaliPro.
Results: We illustrate the usefulness of CaliPro through four examples including predator-prey, infectious disease transmission, and immune response models. We show that CaliPro works well for both deterministic, continuous model structures as well as stochastic, discrete models and illustrate that CaliPro can work across diverse calibration goals.
Conclusions: We present CaliPro, a new method for calibrating complex biological models to a range of experimental outcomes. In addition to expediting calibration, CaliPro may be useful in already calibrated parameter spaces to target and isolate specific model behavior for further analysis.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.05132},
	abstract = {Generative models rely on the key idea that data can be represented in terms of latent variables which are uncorrelated by definition. Lack of correlation is important because it suggests that the latent space manifold is simpler to understand and manipulate. Generative models are widely used in deep learning, e.g., variational autoencoders (VAEs) and generative adversarial networks (GANs). Here we propose a method to build a set of linearly independent vectors in the latent space of a GANs, which we call quasi-eigenvectors. These quasi-eigenvectors have two key properties: i) They span all the latent space, ii) A set of these quasi-eigenvectors map to each of the labeled features one-on-one. We show that in the case of the MNIST, while the number of dimensions in latent space is large by construction, 98\% of the data in real space map to a sub-domain of latent space of dimensionality equal to the number of labels. We then show how the quasi-eigenvalues can be used for Latent Spectral Decomposition (LSD), which has applications in denoising images and for performing matrix operations in latent space that map to feature transformations in real space. We show how this method provides insight into the latent space topology. The key point is that the set of quasi-eigenvectors form a basis set in latent space and each direction corresponds to a feature in real space.},

	abstract = {Continuous space language models have recently demonstrated outstanding results across a variety of tasks. In this paper, we examine the vector-space word representations that are implicitly learned by the input-layer weights. We ﬁnd that these representations are surprisingly good at capturing syntactic and semantic regularities in language, and that each relationship is characterized by a relation-speciﬁc vector offset. This allows vector-oriented reasoning based on the offsets between words. For example, the male/female relationship is automatically learned, and with the induced vector representations, “King Man + Woman” results in a vector very close to “Queen.” We demonstrate that the word vectors capture syntactic regularities by means of syntactic analogy questions (provided with this paper), and are able to correctly answer almost 40\% of the questions. We demonstrate that the word vectors capture semantic regularities by using the vector offset method to answer SemEval-2012 Task 2 questions. Remarkably, this method outperforms the best previous systems.},

We derive a probabilistically grounded deﬁnition of paraphrasing that we re-interpret as word transformation, a mathematical description of “wx is to wy”. From these concepts we prove existence of linear relationships between W2V-type embeddings that underlie the analogical phenomenon, identifying explicit error terms.},

Unlike previous attempts that use linear programming, our method is based on a dynamical formulation of quadratic optimal transport proposed for flat domains by Benamou and Brenier [2000], adapted to discrete surfaces. Our structure-preserving construction yields a Riemannian metric on the (finite-dimensional) space of probability distributions on a discrete surface, which translates the so-called Otto calculus to discrete language. From a practical perspective, our technique provides a smooth interpolation between distributions on discrete surfaces with less diffusion than state-of-the-art algorithms involving entropic regularization. Beyond interpolation, we show how our discrete notion of optimal transport extends to other tasks, such as distribution-valued Dirichlet problems and time integration of gradient flows.},

However, dicotyledon leaf venation has a large number of closed loops, which are functional and able to transport fluid in the event of damage to any vein, including the primary veins. Inspired by leaf venation, we study two possible reasons for the existence of a high density of loops in transport networks: resilience to damage and fluctuations in load. In the first case, we seek the optimal transport network in the presence of random damage by averaging over damage to each link. In the second case, we seek the network that optimizes transport when the load is sparsely distributed: at any given time most sinks are closed. We find that both criteria lead to the presence of loops in the optimum state.},

Comparatively, unsupervised learning with CNNs has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of CNNs for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of CNNs called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks (DCGANs), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

	url = {https://www.icrp.org/publication.asp?id=icrp%20publication%2089},
	abstract = {This report presents detailed information on age- and gender-related differences in the anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals. These reference values provide needed input to prospective dosimetry calculations for radiation protection purposes for both workers and members of the general public.

The purpose of this report is to consolidate and unify in one publication, important new information on reference anatomical and physiological values that has become available since Publication 23 was published by the ICRP in 1975. There are two aspects of this work. The first is to revise and extend the information in Publication 23 as appropriate. The second is to provide additional information on individual variation among grossly normal individuals resulting from differences in age, gender, race, or other factors.

This publication collects, unifies, and expands the updated ICRP reference values for the purpose of providing a comprehensive and consistent set of age- and gender-specific reference values for anatomical and physiological features of the human body pertinent to radiation dosimetry. The reference values given in this report are based on: (a) anatomical and physiological information not published before by the ICRP; (b) recent ICRP publications containing reference value information; and © information in Publication 23 that is still considered valid and appropriate for radiation protection purposes.

Moving from the past emphasis on ‘Reference Man’, the new report presents a series of reference values for both male and female subjects of six different ages: newborn, 1 year, 5 years, 10 years, 15 years, and adult. In selecting reference values, the Commission has used data on Western Europeans and North Americans because these populations have been well studied with respect to anatomy, body composition, and physiology. When appropriate, comparisons are made between the chosen reference values and data from several Asian populations.

The first section of the report provides summary tables of all the anatomical and physiological parameters given as reference values in this publication. These results give a comprehensive view of reference values for an individual as influenced by age and gender.

The second section describes characteristics of dosimetric importance for the embryo and fetus. Information is provided on the development of the total body and the timing of appearance and development of the various organ systems. Reference values are provided on the mass of the total body and selected organs and tissues, as well as a number of physiological parameters.

The third section deals with reference values of important anatomical and physiological characteristics of reference individuals from birth to adulthood. This section begins with details on the growth and composition of the total body in males and females. It then describes and quantifies anatomical and physiological characteristics of various organ systems and changes in these characteristics during growth, maturity, and pregnancy. Reference values are specified for characteristics of dosimetric importance.

The final section gives a brief summary of the elemental composition of individuals. Focusing on the elements of dosimetric importance, information is presented on the body content of 13 elements: calcium, carbon, chloride, hydrogen, iodine, iron, magnesium, nitrogen, oxygen, potassium, sodium, sulphur, and phosphorus.},

We encoded the complete kinetics of infection for coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), a compact and fastacting RNA virus. The kinetics are built from detailed modules for viral binding–delivery, translation–replication, and encapsidation. Specific module activities are dampened by the type I interferon response to viral double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs), which is itself disrupted by viral proteinases. The validated kinetics uncovered that cleavability of the dsRNA transducer mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) becomes a stronger determinant of viral outcomes when cells receive supplemental interferon after infection. Cleavability is naturally altered in humans by a common MAVS polymorphism, which removes a proteinase-targeted site but paradoxically elevates CVB3 infectivity. These observations are reconciled with a simple nonlinear model of MAVS regulation. Modeling complete kinetics is an attainable goal for small, rapidly infecting viruses and perhaps viral pathogens more broadly.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Mucus serves as a physical barrier against foreign particles, including toxins, pathogens, and environmental ultrafine particles, while allowing rapid passage of selected gases, ions, nutrients, and many proteins. Its selective barrier properties are precisely regulated at the biochemical level across vastly different length scales. At the macroscale, mucus behaves as a non-Newtonian gel, distinguished from classical solids and liquids by its response to shear rate and shear stress, while, at the nanoscale, it behaves as a low viscosity fluid. Advances in the rheological characterization of mucus from the macroscopic to nanoscopic levels have contributed critical understanding to mucus physiology, disease pathology, and the development of drug delivery systems designed for use at mucosal surfaces. This article reviews the biochemistry that governs mucus rheology, the macro- and microrheology of human and laboratory animal mucus, rheological techniques applied to mucus, and the importance of an improved understanding of the physical properties of mucus to advancing the field of drug and gene delivery.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) replicates throughout human airways. The polarized human airway epithelium (HAE) cultured at an airway-liquid interface (HAE-ALI) is an in vitro model mimicking the in vivo human mucociliary airway epithelium and supports the replication of SARSCoV-2. Prior studies characterized only short-period SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE. In this study, continuously monitoring the SARS-CoV-2 infection in HAE-ALI cultures for a long period of up to 51 days revealed that SARS-CoV-2 infection was long lasting with recurrent replication peaks appearing between an interval of approximately 7 to 10 days, which was consistent in all the tested HAE-ALI cultures derived from 4 lung bronchi of independent donors. We also identiﬁed that SARS-CoV-2 does not infect HAE from the basolateral side, and the dominant SARS-CoV-2 permissive epithelial cells are ciliated cells and goblet cells, whereas virus replication in basal cells and club cells was not detected. Notably, virus infection immediately damaged the HAE, which is demonstrated by dispersed zonula occludens-1 (ZO-1) expression without clear tight junctions and partial loss of cilia. Importantly, we identiﬁed that SARS-CoV-2 productive infection of HAE requires a high viral load of Ͼ2.5 ϫ 105 virions per cm2 of epithelium. Thus, our studies highlight the importance of a high viral load and that epithelial renewal initiates and maintains a recurrent infection of HAE with SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {Antiviral gets the jump on coronaviruses
Like other emerging infections, coronaviruses can jump from animal reservoirs into the human population with devastating effects, such as the SARS or MERS outbreaks. Sheahan et al. tested a small-molecule inhibitor that has shown activity against Ebola virus as a potential agent to be used to fight coronaviruses. This drug was effective against multiple types of coronaviruses in cell culture and in a mouse model of SARS and did not seem to be toxic. Given its broad activity, this antiviral could be deployed to prevent spreading of a future coronavirus outbreak, regardless of the specific virus that jumps over.
Emerging viral infections are difficult to control because heterogeneous members periodically cycle in and out of humans and zoonotic hosts, complicating the development of specific antiviral therapies and vaccines. Coronaviruses (CoVs) have a proclivity to spread rapidly into new host species causing severe disease. Severe acute respiratory syndrome CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV) successively emerged, causing severe epidemic respiratory disease in immunologically naïve human populations throughout the globe. Broad-spectrum therapies capable of inhibiting CoV infections would address an immediate unmet medical need and could be invaluable in the treatment of emerging and endemic CoV infections. We show that a nucleotide prodrug, GS-5734, currently in clinical development for treatment of Ebola virus disease, can inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV replication in multiple in vitro systems, including primary human airway epithelial cell cultures with submicromolar IC50 values. GS-5734 was also effective against bat CoVs, prepandemic bat CoVs, and circulating contemporary human CoV in primary human lung cells, thus demonstrating broad-spectrum anti-CoV activity. In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic administration of GS-5734 significantly reduced lung viral load and improved clinical signs of disease as well as respiratory function. These data provide substantive evidence that GS-5734 may prove effective against endemic MERS-CoV in the Middle East, circulating human CoV, and, possibly most importantly, emerging CoV of the future.

Although the previous coronavirus SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV epidemics raised awareness of the need for clinically available therapeutic or preventive interventions, to date, no treatments with proven efficacy are available. The development of effective intervention strategies relies on the knowledge of molecular and cellular mechanisms of coronavirus infections, which highlights the significance of studying virus–host interactions at the molecular level to identify targets for antiviral intervention and to elucidate critical viral and host determinants that are decisive for the development of severe disease. In this Review, we summarize the first discoveries that shape our current understanding of SARS-CoV-2 infection throughout the intracellular viral life cycle and relate that to our knowledge of coronavirus biology. The elucidation of similarities and differences between SARS-CoV-2 and other coronaviruses will support future preparedness and strategies to combat coronavirus infections.},

	abstract = {Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is an acute infectious disease that spreads mainly via the respiratory route. A distinct coronavirus (SARS‐CoV) has been identified as the aetiological agent of SARS. Recently, a metallopeptidase named angiotensin‐converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been identified as the functional receptor for SARS‐CoV. Although ACE2 mRNA is known to be present in virtually all organs, its protein expression is largely unknown. Since identifying the possible route of infection has major implications for understanding the pathogenesis and future treatment strategies for SARS, the present study investigated the localization of ACE2 protein in various human organs (oral and nasal mucosa, nasopharynx, lung, stomach, small intestine, colon, skin, lymph nodes, thymus, bone marrow, spleen, liver, kidney, and brain). The most remarkable finding was the surface expression of ACE2 protein on lung alveolar epithelial cells and enterocytes of the small intestine. Furthermore, ACE2 was present in arterial and venous endothelial cells and arterial smooth muscle cells in all organs studied. In conclusion, ACE2 is abundantly present in humans in the epithelia of the lung and small intestine, which might provide possible routes of entry for the SARS‐CoV. This epithelial expression, together with the presence of ACE2 in vascular endothelium, also provides a first step in understanding the pathogenesis of the main SARS disease manifestations.

	abstract = {Over the past 20 years, several coronaviruses have crossed the species barrier into humans, causing outbreaks of severe, and often fatal, respiratory illness. Since SARS-CoV was first identified in animal markets, global viromics projects have discovered thousands of coronavirus sequences in diverse animals and geographic regions. Unfortunately, there are few tools available to functionally test these viruses for their ability to infect humans, which has severely hampered efforts to predict the next zoonotic viral outbreak. Here, we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent SARS-CoV-2, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells, and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H1N1) contributes to morbidity and mortality by severe influenza. Oseltamivir and zanamivir are recommended for treating and preventing influenza worldwide. In Brazil, this official recommendation lacks an economic evaluation. Our objective was to assess the efficiency of influenza A chemoprophylaxis in the Brazilian context. METHODS: We assessed the cost-effectiveness of oseltamivir and zanamivir for prophylaxis of influenza for high risk population, compared to no prophylaxis, in the perspective of Brazilian public health system. Quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and effectiveness data were based on literature review and costs in Brazilian real (BRL) were estimated from official sources and micro-costing of 2016’s H1N1 admissions at a university hospital. We used a decision-tree model considering prophylaxis and no prophylaxis and the probabilities of H1N1, ambulatory care, admission to hospital, intensive care, patient discharge and death. Adherence and adverse events from prophylaxis were included. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was converted to 2016 United States dollar (USD).Uncertainty was assessed with univariated and probabilistic sensitivity analysis. RESULTS: Adherence to prophylaxis was 0.70 (confidence interval [CI] 95\% 0.54; 0.83); adverse events, 0.09 (CI 95\% 0.02; 0.18); relative risk of H1N1 in chemoprophylaxis, 0.43 (CI 95\% 0.33; 0.57); incidence of H1N1, 0.14 (CI 95\% 0.11; 0.16); ambulatory care, 0.67 (CI 95\% 0.58; 0.75); hospital admission,0.43 (CI 95\% 0.39; 0.42); hospital mortality, 0.14 (CI 95\% 0.12; 0.15); intensive care unit admission, 0.23 (CI 95\% 0.20; 0.27); and intensive care mortality, 0.40 (CI 95\% 0.29; 0.52). QALY in H1N1 state was 0.50 (CI 95\% 0.46; 0.53); in H1N1 inpatients, 0.23 (CI 95\% 0.18; 0.28); healthy, 0.885 (CI 95\% 0.879; 0.891); death, 0. Adverse events estimated to affect QALY in -0.185 (CI 95\% -0.290; -0.050). Cost for chemoprophylaxis was BRL 39.42 (standard deviation [SD] 17.94); ambulatory care, BRL 12.47 (SD 5.21); hospital admission, BRL 5,727.59 (SD 7,758.28); intensive care admission, BRL 19,217.25 (SD 7,917.33); and adverse events, BRL 292.05 (SD 724.95). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratio was BRL-4,080.63 (USD -1,263.74)/QALY and -982.39 (USD -304.24)/H1N1 prevented. Results were robust to sensitivity analysis. CONCLUSION: Chemoprophylaxis of influenza A (H1N1) is cost-saving in Brazilian health system context.},

Relevant reports have pointed out the novel coronavirus has 80\% homology with SARS. In the difficulty where new synthesized drug cannot be applied immediately to patients, “conventional drug in new use” becomes a feasible solution. The first medication experience of the recovered patients in the US has led remdesivir to be the “specific drug”. China has also taken immediate action to put remdesivir into clinical trials with the purpose of applying it into clinical therapeutics for Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19).

	abstract = {The progression of acute hepatitis B virus (HBV) to chronic infection or clearance is highly dependent on the host immune response composed of cytolytic (CTL) and non-cytolytic (non-CTL) effects. Cytolytic processes induce hepatocyte killing while non-CTL processes inhibit intracellular replication. Both effects are widely recognized and accepted. However, there are uncertainties about the assistance provided by either the loss of covalently circular closed DNA (cccDNA) during cell proliferation or the emergence of refractory cells to immune mediated clearance. We developed an agent-based mathematical model and tested the relative roles of different mechanisms of the immune system in the clearance of acute HBV infection. HBV viremia clearance time and hepatocyte turnover (HT) were used as the two major criteria in determining reasonable outcomes. Modelling results in 90\% of cells containing between 1 and 17 cccDNA copies and normally distributed at the peak of infection. Variations in p36 levels, responsible for determining export of virions or recirculation to amplify cccDNA numbers, have a much greater impact on mean cccDNA level/cell at peak viremia than virus infectivity and cccDNA half-life. A strong CTL effect alone failed to clear infection with HT≈10. Acute infection clearance was possible with combined CTL and non-CTL effects along with complete loss of intracellular viral components during cell proliferation resulting in the desired range of HT (0.7–1). The emergence of cells refractory to infection can reduce HT by up to 90\%. However their impact was less effective than complete loss of intracellular viral components during cell proliferation. Conclusion: the existence of refractory cells is not necessary when there is complete loss of intracellular quantities during cell proliferation but is essential with only partial clearance.},

While factors associated with scientific culture and practical practice are most often invoked, I propose that the Crisis of Reproducibility is ultimately a failure of generalization with a fundamental scientific basis in the methods used for biomedical research. The Denominator Problem describes how limitations intrinsic to the two primary approaches of biomedical research, clinical studies and preclinical experimental biology, lead to an inability to effectively characterize the full extent of biological heterogeneity, which compromises the task of generalizing acquired knowledge. Drawing on the example of the unifying role of theory in the physical sciences, I propose that multi-scale mathematical and dynamic computational models, when mapped to the modular structure of biological systems, can serve a unifying role as formal representations of what is conserved and similar from one biological context to another. This ability to explicitly describe the generation of heterogeneity from similarity addresses the Denominator Problem and provides a scientific response to the Crisis of Reproducibility.},

	abstract = {Sepsis is a life-threatening condition affecting one million people per year in the US in which dysregulation of the body's own immune system causes damage to its tissues, resulting in a 28 - 50\% mortality rate. Clinical trials for sepsis treatment over the last 20 years have failed to produce a single currently FDA approved drug treatment. In this study, we attempt to discover an effective cytokine mediation treatment strategy for sepsis using a previously developed agent-based model that simulates the innate immune response to infection: the Innate Immune Response agent-based model (IIRABM). Previous attempts at reducing mortality with multi-cytokine mediation using the IIRABM have failed to reduce mortality across all patient parameterizations and motivated us to investigate whether adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation can control the trajectory of sepsis and lower patient mortality. We used the IIRABM to compute a treatment policy in which systemic patient measurements are used in a feedback loop to inform future treatment. Using deep reinforcement learning, we identified a policy that achieves 0\% mortality on the patient parameterization on which it was trained. More importantly, this policy also achieves 0.8\% mortality over 500 randomly selected patient parameterizations with baseline mortalities ranging from 1 - 99\% (with an average of 49\%) spanning the entire clinically plausible parameter space of the IIRABM. These results suggest that adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy could be a promising approach for treating sepsis. We hope that this work motivates researchers to consider such an approach as part of future clinical trials. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to consider adaptive, personalized multi-cytokine mediation therapy for sepsis, and is the first to exploit deep reinforcement learning on a biological simulation.},

	abstract = {Deep learning\&rsquo;s automatic feature extraction has proven its superior performance over traditional fingerprint-based features in the implementation of virtual screening models. However, these models face multiple challenges in the field of early drug discovery, such as over-training and generalization to unseen data, due to the inherently unbalanced and small datasets. In this work, the TranScreen pipeline is proposed, which utilizes transfer learning and a collection of weight initializations to overcome these challenges. An amount of 182 graph convolutional neural networks are trained on molecular source datasets and the learned knowledge is transferred to the target task for fine-tuning. The target task of p53-based bioactivity prediction, an important factor for anti-cancer discovery, is chosen to showcase the capability of the pipeline. Having trained a collection of source models, three different approaches are implemented to compare and rank them for a given task before fine-tuning. The results show improvement in performance of the model in multiple cases, with the best model increasing the area under receiver operating curve ROC-AUC from 0.75 to 0.91 and the recall from 0.25 to 1. This improvement is vital for practical virtual screening via lowering the false negatives and demonstrates the potential of transfer learning. The code and pre-trained models are made accessible online.},

	abstract = {Machine learning and data mining techniques have been used in numerous real-world applications. An assumption of traditional machine learning methodologies is the training data and testing data are taken from the same domain, such that the input feature space and data distribution characteristics are the same. However, in some real-world machine learning scenarios, this assumption does not hold. There are cases where training data is expensive or difficult to collect. Therefore, there is a need to create high-performance learners trained with more easily obtained data from different domains. This methodology is referred to as transfer learning. This survey paper formally defines transfer learning, presents information on current solutions, and reviews applications applied to transfer learning. Lastly, there is information listed on software downloads for various transfer learning solutions and a discussion of possible future research work. The transfer learning solutions surveyed are independent of data size and can be applied to big data environments.},

	doi = {10.1186/1471-2105-8-4},
	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Vaccine development in the post-genomic era often begins with the in silico screening of genome information, with the most probable protective antigens being predicted rather than requiring causative microorganisms to be grown. Despite the obvious advantages of this approach--such as speed and cost efficiency--its success remains dependent on the accuracy of antigen prediction. Most approaches use sequence alignment to identify antigens. This is problematic for several reasons. Some proteins lack obvious sequence similarity, although they may share similar structures and biological properties. The antigenicity of a sequence may be encoded in a subtle and recondite manner not amendable to direct identification by sequence alignment. The discovery of truly novel antigens will be frustrated by their lack of similarity to antigens of known provenance. To overcome the limitations of alignment-dependent methods, we propose a new alignment-free approach for antigen prediction, which is based on auto cross covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequences into uniform vectors of principal amino acid properties.
RESULTS: Bacterial, viral and tumour protein datasets were used to derive models for prediction of whole protein antigenicity. Every set consisted of 100 known antigens and 100 non-antigens. The derived models were tested by internal leave-one-out cross-validation and external validation using test sets. An additional five training sets for each class of antigens were used to test the stability of the discrimination between antigens and non-antigens. The models performed well in both validations showing prediction accuracy of 70\% to 89\%. The models were implemented in a server, which we call VaxiJen.
CONCLUSION: VaxiJen is the first server for alignment-independent prediction of protective antigens. It was developed to allow antigen classification solely based on the physicochemical properties of proteins without recourse to sequence alignment. The server can be used on its own or in combination with alignment-based prediction methods. It is freely-available online at the URL: http://www.jenner.ac.uk/VaxiJen.},

RV has become firmly established following the development of the BEXSERO® vaccine against Neisseria meningitidis serogroup B. RV studies have begun to incorporate machine learning (ML) techniques to distinguish bacterial protective antigens (BPAs) from non-BPAs. This research contributes significantly to the RV field by using permutation analysis to demonstrate that a signal for protective antigens can be curated from published data. Furthermore, the effects of the following on an ML approach to RV were also assessed: nested cross-validation, balancing selection of non-BPAs for subcellular localization, increasing the training data, and incorporating greater numbers of protein annotation tools for feature generation. These enhancements yielded a support vector machine (SVM) classifier that could discriminate BPAs (n = 200) from non-BPAs (n = 200) with an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.787. In addition, hierarchical clustering of BPAs revealed that intracellular BPAs clustered separately from extracellular BPAs. However, no immediate benefit was derived when training SVM classifiers on data sets exclusively containing intra- or extracellular BPAs. In conclusion, this work demonstrates that ML classifiers have great utility in RV approaches and will lead to new subunit vaccines in the future.},

Our method adapts generative adversarial networks (GANs) to operate directly on

objective to encourage the generation of molecules with specific desired
chemical properties. In experiments on the QM9 chemical database, we
demonstrate that our model is capable of generating close to 100\% valid

	abstract = {As high-throughput biological sequencing becomes faster and cheaper, the need to extract useful information from sequencing becomes ever more paramount, often limited by low-throughput experimental characterizations. For proteins, accurate prediction of their functions directly from their primary amino-acid sequences has been a long standing challenge. Here, machine learning using artificial recurrent neural networks (RNN) was applied towards classification of protein function directly from primary sequence without sequence alignment, heuristic scoring or feature engineering. The RNN models containing long-short-term-memory (LSTM) units trained on public, annotated datasets from UniProt achieved high performance for in-class prediction of four important protein functions tested, particularly compared to other machine learning algorithms using sequence-derived protein features. RNN models were used also for out-of-class predictions of phylogenetically distinct protein families with similar functions, including proteins of the CRISPR-associated nuclease, ferritin-like iron storage and cytochrome P450 families. Applying the trained RNN models on the partially unannotated UniRef100 database predicted not only candidates validated by existing annotations but also currently unannotated sequences. Some RNN predictions for the ferritin-like iron sequestering function were experimentally validated, even though their sequences differ significantly from known, characterized proteins and from each other and cannot be easily predicted using popular bioinformatics methods. As sequencing and experimental characterization data increases rapidly, the machine-learning approach based on RNN could be useful for discovery and prediction of homologues for a wide range of protein functions.},

In this study, we explored the prospects of building good quality interpretable QSARs for big and diverse datasets, without using any pre-calculated descriptors. We have used different forms of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks to achieve this, trained directly using either traditional SMILES codes or a new linear molecular notation developed as part of this work. Three endpoints were modeled: Ames mutagenicity, inhibition of P. falciparum Dd2 and inhibition of Hepatitis C Virus, with training sets ranging from 7866 to 31919 compounds. To boost the interpretability of the prediction results, attention-based machine learning mechanism, jointly with a bidirectional LSTM was used to detect structural alerts for the mutagenicity data set. Traditional fragment descriptor-based models were used for comparison. As per the results of the external and cross-validation experiments, overall prediction accuracies of the LSTM models were close to the fragment-based models. However, LSTM models were superior in predicting test chemicals that are dissimilar to the training set compounds, a coveted quality of QSAR models in real world applications. In summary, it is possible to build QSAR models using LSTMs without using pre-computed traditional descriptors, and models are far from being ‘black box’.

In response, solutions that exploit the structure and sparsity of the learned attention matrix have blossomed. However, real-world applications that involve long sequences, such as biological sequence analysis, may fall short of meeting these assumptions, precluding exploration of these models. To address this challenge, we present a new Transformer architecture, Performer, based on Fast Attention Via Orthogonal Random features (FAVOR). Our mechanism scales linearly rather than quadratically in the number of tokens in the sequence, is characterized by sub-quadratic space complexity and does not incorporate any sparsity pattern priors. Furthermore, it provides strong theoretical guarantees: unbiased estimation of the attention matrix and uniform convergence. It is also backwards-compatible with pre-trained regular Transformers.

	abstract = {Inflammation and airway remodeling occur in a variety of airway diseases. Modeling aspects of the inflammatory and fibrotic processes following repeated exposure to particulate matter may provide insights into a spectrum of airway diseases, as well as prevention/treatment strategies. An agent-based model (ABM) was created to examine the response of an abstracted population of inflammatory cells (nominally macrophages, but possibly including other inflammatory cells such as lymphocytes) and cells involved in remodeling (nominally fibroblasts) to particulate exposure. The model focused on a limited number of relevant interactions, specifically those among macrophages, fibroblasts, a pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-α), an anti-inflammatory cytokine (TGF-β1), collagen deposition, and tissue damage. The model yielded three distinct states that were equated with (1) self-resolving inflammation and a return to baseline, (2) a pro-inflammatory process of localized tissue damage and fibrosis, and (3) elevated pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines, persistent tissue damage, and fibrosis outcomes. Experimental results consistent with these predicted states were observed in histology sections of lung tissue from mice exposed to particulate matter. Systematic in silico studies suggested that the development of each state depended primarily upon the degree and duration of exposure. Thus, a relatively simple ABM resulted in several, biologically feasible, emergent states, suggesting that the model captures certain salient features of inflammation following exposure of the lung to particulate matter. This ABM may hold future utility in the setting of airway disease resulting from inflammation and fibrosis following particulate exposure.},

In this paper, we present a delay differential model to describe influenza A (H1N1) dynamics. We begin by presenting the model with a brief discussion, followed by proving the positivity and boundedness of the model solution. We establish sufficient conditions for the global stability of the equilibria (the infection free equilibrium and the infected equilibrium), these conditions are obtained by means of the Lyapunov LaSalle invariance principle of the system. Also we have carried out bifurcation analysis along with an estimated length of delay to preserve the stability behavior. In particular, we show the threshold dynamics in the sense that if (reproduction number) R0{\textless}1 the infectious population disappear so the disease dies out, while if R0{\textgreater}1 the infectious population persist. Sensitivity analysis of the influenza A (H1N1) model reveals which parameter values have a major impact on the model dynamics. Numerical simulations with application to H1N1 infection are given to verify the analytical results.},

	abstract = {Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the earliest recorded human diseases and still one of the deadliest worldwide. Its causative agent is the bacteria Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). Cytokine-mediated macrophage activation is a necessary step in control of bacterial growth, and early immunologic events in lymph node and lung are crucial to the outcome of infection, although the factors that influence these environments and the immune response are poorly understood. Our goal is to build the next-generation two-compartmental model of the immune response to provide a gateway to more spatial and mechanistic investigations of M. tuberculosis infection in the LN and lung. Crucial immune factors emerge that affect macrophage populations and inflammation, namely TNF-dependent recruitment and apoptosis, and IL-10 levels. Surprisingly, bacterial load plays a less important role than TNF in increasing the population of infected macrophages and inflammation. Using a mathematical model, it is possible to distinguish the effects of pro-inflammatory (TNF) and anti-inflammatory (IL-10) cytokines on the spectrum of phagocyte populations (macrophages and dendritic cells) in the lung and lymph node. Our results suggest that TNF is a major mediator of recruitment of phagocytes to the lungs. In contrast, IL-10 plays a role in balancing the dominant macrophage phenotype in LN and lung.},

        To gain insights into individual variations in acute inflammation and physiology.
        Design: 
        Large-animal study combined with mathematical modeling.
        Setting: 
        Academic large-animal and computational laboratories.
        Subjects: 
        Outbred juvenile swine.
        Interventions: 
        Four swine were instrumented and subjected to endotoxemia (100 µg/kg), followed by serial plasma sampling.
        Measurements and Main Results: 
        Swine exhibited various degrees of inflammation and acute lung injury, including one death with severe acute lung injury (PaO2/FIO2 ratio μ200 and static compliance μ10 L/cm H2O). Plasma interleukin-1β, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, interleukin-8, interleukin-10, tumor necrosis factor-α, high mobility group box-1, and NO2-/NO3- were significantly (p μ .05) elevated over the course of the experiment. Principal component analysis was used to suggest principal drivers of inflammation. Based in part on principal component analysis, an ordinary differential equation model was constructed, consisting of the lung and the blood (as a surrogate for the rest of the body), in which endotoxin induces tumor necrosis factor-α in monocytes in the blood, followed by the trafficking of these cells into the lung leading to the release of high mobility group box-1, which in turn stimulates the release of interleukin-1β from resident macrophages. The ordinary differential equation model also included blood pressure, PaO2, and FIO2, and a damage variable that summarizes the health of the animal. This ordinary differential equation model could be fit to both inflammatory and physiologic data in the individual swine. The predicted time course of damage could be matched to the oxygen index in three of the four swine.
        Conclusions: 
        The approach described herein may aid in predicting inflammation and physiologic dysfunction in small cohorts of subjects with diverse phenotypes and outcomes.},

	abstract = {The understanding of the immune response is right now at the center of biomedical research. There are growing expectations that immune-based interventions will in the midterm provide new, personalized, and targeted therapeutic options for many severe and highly prevalent diseases, from aggressive cancers to infectious and autoimmune diseases. To this end, immunology should surpass its current descriptive and phenomenological nature, and become quantitative, and thereby predictive.Immunology is an ideal field for deploying the tools, methodologies, and philosophy of systems biology, an approach that combines quantitative experimental data, computational biology, and mathematical modeling. This is because, from an organism-wide perspective, the immunity is a biological system of systems, a paradigmatic instance of a multi-scale system. At the molecular scale, the critical phenotypic responses of immune cells are governed by large biochemical networks, enriched in nested regulatory motifs such as feedback and feedforward loops. This network complexity confers them the ability of highly nonlinear behavior, including remarkable examples of homeostasis, ultra-sensitivity, hysteresis, and bistability. Moving from the cellular level, different immune cell populations communicate with each other by direct physical contact or receiving and secreting signaling molecules such as cytokines. Moreover, the interaction of the immune system with its potential targets (e.g., pathogens or tumor cells) is far from simple, as it involves a number of attack and counterattack mechanisms that ultimately constitute a tightly regulated multi-feedback loop system. From a more practical perspective, this leads to the consequence that today’s immunologists are facing an ever-increasing challenge of integrating massive quantities from multi-platforms.In this chapter, we support the idea that the analysis of the immune system demands the use of systems-level approaches to ensure the success in the search for more effective and personalized immune-based therapies.},

In this review, we present long-accepted modeling techniques and novel strategies for simulating various lung injuries to highlight the usefulness of mathematical modeling in addressing these life-threatening conditions. Advances in computational power have allowed for a diverse collection of models ranging from those using only Boolean operators to complex hybrid multi-scale models, each specifically designed to address relevant biological questions.

Based on the discovery of drug metabolites, new chemical entities can be identified and potential safety hazards caused by reactive or toxic metabolites can be minimized. Nowadays, computational methods are usually complementary tools for experiments. However, current metabolites prediction methods tend to have high false positive rates with low accuracy and are usually only used for specific enzyme systems. In order to overcome this difficulty, a method was developed in this paper by first establishing a database with broad coverage of SMARTS-coded metabolic reaction rule, and then extracting the molecular fingerprints of compounds to construct a classification model based on deep learning algorithms. The metabolic reaction rule database we built can supplement chemically reasonable negative reaction examples. Based on deep learning algorithms, the model could determine which reaction types are more likely to occur than the others. In the test set, our method can achieve the accuracy of 70\% (Top-10), which is significantly higher than that of random guess and the rule-based method SyGMa. The results demonstrated that our method has a certain predictive ability and application value.},

Second, we trained two Graph-CNNs to automatically extract features from pocket graphs and 2D ligand graphs, respectively, driven by binding classification labels. We demonstrate that graph-autoencoders can learn fixed-size representations for protein pockets of varying sizes and the Graph-CNN framework can effectively capture protein-ligand binding interactions without relying on target-ligand complexes. Across several metrics, Graph-CNNs achieved better or comparable performance to 3DCNN ligand-scoring, AutoDock Vina, RF-Score, and NNScore on common virtual screening benchmark data sets. Visualization of key pocket residues and ligand atoms contributing to the classification decisions confirms that our networks are able to detect important interface residues and ligand atoms within the pockets and ligands, respectively.},

For all 13 data sets, Chemi-Net resulted in higher R2 values compared with the Cubist benchmark. The median R2 increase rate over Cubist was 26.7\%.

We present a feature representation approach termed REFINED (REpresentation of Features as Images with NEighborhood Dependencies) to arrange high-dimensional vectors in a compact image form conducible for CNN-based deep learning. We consider the similarities between features to generate a concise feature map in the form of a two-dimensional image by minimizing the pairwise distance values following a Bayesian Metric Multidimensional Scaling Approach. We hypothesize that this approach enables embedded feature extraction and, integrated with CNN-based deep learning, can boost the predictive accuracy. We illustrate the superior predictive capabilities of the proposed framework as compared to state-of-the-art methodologies in drug sensitivity prediction scenarios using synthetic datasets, drug chemical descriptors as predictors from NCI60, and both transcriptomic information and drug descriptors as predictors from GDSC.},

	abstract = {Reaction predictor is an application for predicting chemical reactions and reaction pathways. It uses deep learning to predict and rank elementary reactions by first identifying electron sources and sinks, pairing those sources and sinks to propose elementary reactions, and finally ranking the reactions by favorability. Global reactions can be identified by chaining together these elementary reaction predictions. We carefully curated a data set consisting of over 11 000 elementary reactions, covering a broad range of advanced organic chemistry. Using this data for training, we demonstrate an 80\% top-5 recovery rate on a separate, challenging benchmark set of reactions drawn from modern organic chemistry literature. A fundamental problem of synthetic chemistry is the identification of unknown products observed via mass spectrometry. Reaction predictor includes a pathway search feature that can help identify such products through multi-target mass search. Finally, we discuss an alternative approach to predicting electron sources and sinks using recurrent neural networks, specifically long short-term memory (LSTM) architectures, operating directly on SMILES strings. This approach has shown promising preliminary results.},

	abstract = {Neural networks were widely used for quantitative structure–activity relationships (QSAR) in the 1990s. Because of various practical issues (e.g., slow on large problems, difficult to train, prone to overfitting, etc.), they were superseded by more robust methods like support vector machine (SVM) and random forest (RF), which arose in the early 2000s. The last 10 years has witnessed a revival of neural networks in the machine learning community thanks to new methods for preventing overfitting, more efficient training algorithms, and advancements in computer hardware. In particular, deep neural nets (DNNs), i.e. neural nets with more than one hidden layer, have found great successes in many applications, such as computer vision and natural language processing. Here we show that DNNs can routinely make better prospective predictions than RF on a set of large diverse QSAR data sets that are taken from Merck’s drug discovery effort. The number of adjustable parameters needed for DNNs is fairly large, but our results show that it is not necessary to optimize them for individual data sets, and a single set of recommended parameters can achieve better performance than RF for most of the data sets we studied. The usefulness of the parameters is demonstrated on additional data sets not used in the calibration. Although training DNNs is still computationally intensive, using graphical processing units (GPUs) can make this issue manageable.},

Scientists across the world are working to understand severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the virus that causes coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). Zhang et al. determined the x-ray crystal structure of a key protein in the virus' life cycle: the main protease. This enzyme cuts the polyproteins translated from viral RNA to yield functional viral proteins. The authors also developed a lead compound into a potent inhibitor and obtained a structure with the inhibitor bound, work that may provide a basis for development of anticoronaviral drugs.
Science, this issue p. 409
The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome–coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is a global health emergency. An attractive drug target among coronaviruses is the main protease (Mpro, also called 3CLpro) because of its essential role in processing the polyproteins that are translated from the viral RNA. We report the x-ray structures of the unliganded SARS-CoV-2 Mpro and its complex with an α-ketoamide inhibitor. This was derived from a previously designed inhibitor but with the P3-P2 amide bond incorporated into a pyridone ring to enhance the half-life of the compound in plasma. On the basis of the unliganded structure, we developed the lead compound into a potent inhibitor of the SARS-CoV-2 Mpro. The pharmacokinetic characterization of the optimized inhibitor reveals a pronounced lung tropism and suitability for administration by the inhalative route.
Optimized inhibitor of a key enzyme of the novel coronavirus exhibits pronounced lung tropism.

Although the case fatality rate is not high, the number of people infected is large and there is still a large number of patients dying. With the collation and publication of more and more clinical data, a large number of data suggest that there are mild or severe cytokine storms in severe patients, which is an important cause of death. Therefore, treatment of the cytokine storm has become an important part of rescuing severe COVID-19 patients. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) plays an important role in cytokine release syndrome. If it is possible to block the signal transduction pathway of IL-6, it is expected to become a new method for the treatment of severe COVID-19 patients.

It is possible to infer which amino acid residues are in contact by analysing covariation in homologous sequences, which aids in the prediction of protein structures3. Here we show that we can train a neural network to make accurate predictions of the distances between pairs of residues, which convey more information about the structure than contact predictions. Using this information, we construct a potential of mean force4 that can accurately describe the shape of a protein. We find that the resulting potential can be optimized by a simple gradient descent algorithm to generate structures without complex sampling procedures. The resulting system, named AlphaFold, achieves high accuracy, even for sequences with fewer homologous sequences. In the recent Critical Assessment of Protein Structure Prediction5 (CASP13)—a blind assessment of the state of the field—AlphaFold created high-accuracy structures (with template modelling (TM) scores6 of 0.7 or higher) for 24 out of 43 free modelling domains, whereas the next best method, which used sampling and contact information, achieved such accuracy for only 14 out of 43 domains. AlphaFold represents a considerable advance in protein-structure prediction. We expect this increased accuracy to enable insights into the function and malfunction of proteins, especially in cases for which no structures for homologous proteins have been experimentally determined7.},

	abstract = {A new coronavirus, known as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), is the aetiological agent responsible for the 2019–2020 viral pneumonia outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)1–4. Currently, there are no targeted therapeutic agents for the treatment of this disease, and effective treatment options remain very limited. Here we describe the results of a programme that aimed to rapidly discover lead compounds for clinical use, by combining structure-assisted drug design, virtual drug screening and high-throughput screening. This programme focused on identifying drug leads that target main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2: Mpro is a key enzyme of coronaviruses and has a pivotal role in mediating viral replication and transcription, making it an attractive drug target for SARS-CoV-25,6. We identified a mechanism-based inhibitor (N3) by computer-aided drug design, and then determined the crystal structure of Mpro of SARS-CoV-2 in complex with this compound. Through a combination of structure-based virtual and high-throughput screening, we assayed more than 10,000 compounds—including approved drugs, drug candidates in clinical trials and other pharmacologically active compounds—as inhibitors of Mpro. Six of these compounds inhibited Mpro, showing half-maximal inhibitory concentration values that ranged from 0.67 to 21.4 μM. One of these compounds (ebselen) also exhibited promising antiviral activity in cell-based assays. Our results demonstrate the efficacy of our screening strategy, which can lead to the rapid discovery of drug leads with clinical potential in response to new infectious diseases for which no specific drugs or vaccines are available.},

	abstract = {Aims
In December 2019, the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) virus has emerged in Wuhan, China. In this research, the first resolved COVID-19 crystal structure (main protease) was targeted in a virtual screening study by of FDA approved drugs dataset. In addition, a knowledge gap in relations of COVID-19 with the previously known fatal Coronaviruses (CoVs) epidemics, SARS and MERS CoVs, was covered by investigation of sequence statistics and phylogenetics.
Materials and methods
Molecular modeling, virtual screening, docking, sequence comparison statistics and phylogenetics of the COVID-19 main protease were investigated.
Key findings
COVID-19 Mpro formed a phylogenetic group with SARS CoV that was distant from MERS CoV. The identity\% was 96.061 and 51.61 for COVID-19/SARS and COVID-19/MERS CoV sequence comparisons, respectively. The top 20 drugs in the virtual screening studies comprised a broad-spectrum antiviral (ribavirin), anti-hepatitis B virus (telbivudine), two vitamins (vitamin B12 and nicotinamide) and other miscellaneous systemically acting drugs. Of special interest, ribavirin had been used in treating cases of SARS CoV.
Significance
The present study provided a comprehensive targeting of the first resolved COVID+19 structure of Mpro and found a suitable save drugs for repurposing against the viral Mpro. Ribavirin, telbivudine, vitamin B12 and nicotinamide can be combined and used for COVID treatment. This initiative relocates already marketed and approved safe drugs for potential use in COVID-treatment.},

Quantum-mechanical (QM) methods are required for describing chemical reactions and other electronic processes, such as charge transfer or electronic excitation. However, QM methods are restricted to systems of up to a few hundred atoms. However, the size and conformational complexity of biopolymers calls for methods capable of treating up to several 100,000 atoms and allowing for simulations over time scales of tens of nanoseconds. This is achieved by highly efficient, force-field-based molecular mechanics (MM) methods. Thus to model large biomolecules the logical approach is to combine the two techniques and to use a QM method for the chemically active region (e.g., substrates and co-factors in an enzymatic reaction) and an MM treatment for the surroundings (e.g., protein and solvent). The resulting schemes are commonly referred to as combined or hybrid QM/MM methods. They enable the modeling of reactive biomolecular systems at a reasonable computational effort while providing the necessary accuracy.},

During winter, the number of viral disease cases and environmental occurrence of antiviral drug surge due to various biotic and abiotic factors such as transmission pathways, human behaviour, susceptibility, and immunity as well as cold climatic conditions. Adsorption and persistence critically determine the fate and transport of viruses in the environment. Inactivation and disinfection of virus include UV, alcohol, and other chemical-base methods but the susceptibility of virus against these methods varies. Wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are major reserviors of antiviral drugs and their metabolites and transformation products. Ecotoxicity of antiviral drug residues against aquatic organisms have been reported, however more threatening is the development of antiviral resistance, both in humans and in wild animal reservoirs.

Many antiviral drugs have been repurposed for treatment but implicated minimal recovery, which further advanced the need for clearer insights and innovation to derive effective therapeutics. Strategically, Noscapine, an approved antitussive drug with positive effects on lung linings may show favorable outcomes synergistically with antiviral drugs in trials. Hence, we have theoretically examined the combinatorial drug therapy by culminating the existing experimental results with in silico analyses. We employed the antitussive noscapine in conjugation with antiviral drugs (Chloroquine, Umifenovir, Hydroxychloroquine, Favlplravir and Galidesivir). We found that Noscapine-Hydroxychloroquine (Nos-Hcq) conjugate has strong binding affinity for the main protease (Mpro) of SARS-CoV-2, which performs key biological function in virus infection and progression. Nos-Hcq was analyzed through molecular dynamics simulation. The MD simulation for 100 ns affirmed the stable binding of conjugation unprecedentedly through RMSD and radius of gyration plots along with critical reaction coordinate binding free energy profile. Also, dynamical residue cross-correlation map with principal component analysis depicted the stable binding of Nos-Hcq conjugate to Mpro domains with optimal secondary structure statistics of complex dynamics. Also, we reveal the drugs with stable binding to major domains of Mpro can significantly improve the work profile of reaction coordinates, drug accession and inhibitory regulation of Mpro. The designed combinatorial therapy paves way for further prioritized in vitro and in vivo investigations for drug with robust binding against Mpro of SARS-CoV-2.},

	abstract = {SARS-COV-2 has roused the scientific community with a call to action to combat the growing pandemic. At the time of this writing, there are as yet no novel antiviral agents or approved vaccines available for deployment as a frontline defense. Understanding the pathobiology of COVID-19 could aid scientists in their discovery of potent antivirals by elucidating unexplored viral pathways. One method for accomplishing this is the leveraging of computational methods to discover new candidate drugs and vaccines in silico. In the last decade, machine learning-based models, trained on specific biomolecules, have offered inexpensive and rapid implementation methods for the discovery of effective viral therapies. Given a target biomolecule, these models are capable of predicting inhibitor candidates in a structural-based manner. If enough data are presented to a model, it can aid the search for a drug or vaccine candidate by identifying patterns within the data. In this review, we focus on the recent advances of COVID-19 drug and vaccine development using artificial intelligence and the potential of intelligent training for the discovery of COVID-19 therapeutics. To facilitate applications of deep learning for SARS-COV-2, we highlight multiple molecular targets of COVID-19, inhibition of which may increase patient survival. Moreover, we present CoronaDB-AI, a dataset of compounds, peptides, and epitopes discovered either in silico or in vitro that can be potentially used for training models in order to extract COVID-19 treatment. The information and datasets provided in this review can be used to train deep learning-based models and accelerate the discovery of effective viral therapies.},

	abstract = {Transmembrane serine protease 2 (TMPRSS2) has been established as one of the host proteins that facilitate entry of coronaviruses into host cells. One of the approaches often employed towards preventing the entry and proliferation of viruses is computer-aided inhibition studies to identify potent compounds that can inhibit activity of viral targets in the host through binding at the active site. In this study, we developed a pharmacophore model of reportedly potent drugs against severe acute respiratory syndrome coronaviruses 1 and 2 (SARS-CoV-1 and -2). The model was used to screen the ZINC database for commercially available compounds having similar features with the experimentally tested drugs. The top 3000 compounds retrieved were docked into the active sites of a homology-modelled TMPRSS2. Docking scores of the top binders were validated and the top-ranked compounds were subjected to ADME, Lipinski’s and medicinal Chemistry property predictions for druglikeness analyses. Two lead compounds, ZINC64606047 and ZINC05296775, were identified having binding affinities higher than those of the reference inhibitors, favorable interactions with TMPRSS2 active site residues and good ADME and medicinal chemistry properties. Molecular dynamics simulation was used to assess the stability and dynamics of the interactions of these compounds with TMPRSS2. Binding free energy and contribution energy evaluations were determined using MMPBSA method. Analyses of the trajectory dynamics collectively established further that the lead compounds bound and interacted stably with active site residues of TMPRSS2. Nonetheless, experimental studies are needed to further assess the potentials of these compounds as possible therapeutics against coronaviruses. Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma.},

We present work that the mammalian SKI complex is a broad-spectrum, host-directed, antiviral drug target. Yeast suppressor screening was utilized to find a functional genetic interaction between proteins from influenza A virus (IAV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) with eukaryotic proteins that may be potential host factors involved in replication. This screening identified the SKI complex as a potential host factor for both viruses. In mammalian systems siRNA-mediated knockdown of SKI genes inhibited replication of IAV and MERS-CoV. In silico modeling and database screening identified a binding pocket on the SKI complex and compounds predicted to bind. Experimental assays of those compounds identified three chemical structures that were antiviral against IAV and MERS-CoV along with the filoviruses Ebola and Marburg and two further coronaviruses, SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2. The mechanism of antiviral activity is through inhibition of viral RNA production. This work defines the mammalian SKI complex as a broad-spectrum antiviral drug target and identifies lead compounds for further development.},

	abstract = {The recent COVID-19 pandemic caused by SARS-CoV-2 has recorded a high number of infected people across the globe. The virulent nature of the virus makes it necessary for us to identify promising therapeutic agents in a time-sensitive manner. The current study utilises an in silico based drug repurposing approach to identify potential anti-viral drug candidates targeting non-structural protein 15 (NSP15), i.e. a uridylate specific endoribonuclease of SARS-CoV-2 which plays an indispensable role in RNA processing and viral immune evasion from the host immune system. The NSP15 protein was screened against an in-house library of 123 antiviral drugs obtained from the DrugBank database from which three promising drug candidates were identified based on their estimated binding affinities (ΔG), estimated inhibition constants (Ki), the orientation of drug molecules in the active site and the key interacting residues of NSP15. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were performed for the screened drug candidates in complex with NSP15 as well as the apo form of NSP15 to mimic their physiological states. Based on the stable MD simulation trajectories, the binding free energies of the screened NSP15-drug complexes were calculated using the MM/PBSA approach. Two candidate drugs, Simeprevir and Paritaprevir, achieved the lowest binding free energies for NSP15, with a value of −259.522 ± 17.579 and −154.051 ± 33.628 kJ/mol, respectively. In addition, their complexes with NSP15 also exhibited the strongest structural stabilities. Taken together, we propose that Simeprevir and Paritaprevir are promising drug candidates to inhibit NSP15 and may act as potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV-2. Communicated by Ramaswamy H.

	abstract = {Objective
To review published economic evaluations of antiviral treatment for pandemics and outbreaks of respiratory illnesses.
Methods
We conducted a systematic review to identify economic evaluations of antiviral treatment for pandemics and outbreaks of respiratory illnesses, including coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19). We searched Medline (EBSCOhost), EMBASE (Ovid), EconLit (Ovid), National Health Service Economic Evaluation Database (Ovid), and Health Technology Assessment (Ovid). The search was last rerun on July 5, 2020. Citation tracking and reference checking were used. Only full economic evaluations published as peer-reviewed articles in the last 10 years were included. Studies were quality assessed using the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence economic evaluation checklist.
Results
Overall, 782 records were identified, of which 14 studies met the inclusion criteria. The studies were mostly conducted in high-income countries. All were model-based. Seven (50\%) were cost-utility analyses, 4 (28.6\%) were cost-effectiveness analyses, 2 (14.3\%) were cost-consequences analyses, and 1 (7.1\%) was a cost-benefit analysis. Strategies including antiviral treatment were found to be either cost-saving or cost-effective, at the study-specific willingness-to-pay thresholds. Empirical treatment was more cost-effective than test-guided treatment for young adults but less so for older adults.
Conclusions
Antiviral treatment for managing pandemics and outbreaks of respiratory illnesses that have very high case fatality rate, similar to COVID-19 pandemic, are likely to be cost-effective either as a standalone intervention or part of a multifaceted strategy. Investing in the development of such curative treatments and promptly evaluating their cost-effectiveness, relative to other strategies in use at the time of their introduction should be the focus going forward to inform resource allocation decisions particularly in low- and middle-income countries.},

Current in-host mathematical models simplify EBOV infection by assuming a single homogeneous compartment of infection. In particular, a recent modeling study assumed the liver as the largest solid organ targeted by EBOV infection and predicted that nearly all cells become refractory to infection within seven days of initial infection without antiviral treatment. We compared our observations of EBOV kinetics in multiple anatomic compartments and hepatocellular injury in a critically ill patient with Ebola virus disease (EVD) with this model\&rsquo;s predictions. We also explored the model\&rsquo;s predictions, with and without antiviral therapy, by recapitulating the model using published inputs and assumptions. Our findings highlight the challenges of modeling EBOV\&ndash;host dynamics and therapeutic efficacy and emphasize the need for iterative interdisciplinary efforts to refine mathematical models that might advance understanding of EVD pathogenesis and treatment.},

	abstract = {The main protease of SARS-CoV-2 is one of the important targets to design and develop antiviral drugs. In this study, we have selected 40 antiviral phytochemicals to find out the best candidates which can act as potent inhibitors against the main protease. Molecular docking is performed using AutoDock Vina and GOLD suite to determine the binding affinities and interactions between the phytochemicals and the main protease. The selected candidates strongly interact with the key Cys145 and His41 residues. To validate the docking interactions, 100 ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations on the five top-ranked inhibitors including hypericin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, baicalin, glabridin, and α-ketoamide-11r are performed. Principal component analysis (PCA) on the MD simulation discloses that baicalin, cyanidin 3-glucoside, and α-ketoamide-11r have structural similarity with the apo-form of the main protease. These findings are also strongly supported by root-mean-square deviation (RMSD), root-mean-square fluctuation (RMSF), radius of gyration (Rg), and solvent accessible surface area (SASA) investigations. PCA is also used to find out the quantitative structure-activity relationship (QSAR) for pattern recognition of the best ligands. Multiple linear regression (MLR) of QSAR reveals the R2 value of 0.842 for the training set and 0.753 for the test set. Our proposed MLR model can predict the favorable binding energy compared with the binding energy detected from molecular docking. ADMET analysis demonstrates that these candidates appear to be safer inhibitors. Our comprehensive computational and statistical analysis show that these selected phytochemicals can be used as potential inhibitors against the SARS-CoV-2.Communicated by Ramaswamy H. Sarma},

	abstract = {The emergence in late 2019 of the coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 has resulted in the breakthrough of the COVID-19 pandemic that is presently affecting a growing number of countries. The development of the pandemic has also prompted an unprecedented effort of the scientific community to understand the molecular bases of the virus infection and to propose rational drug design strategies able to alleviate the serious COVID-19 morbidity. In this context, a strong synergy between the structural biophysics and molecular modeling and simulation communities has emerged, resolving at the atomistic level the crucial protein apparatus of the virus and revealing the dynamic aspects of key viral processes. In this Review, we focus on how in silico studies have contributed to the understanding of the SARS-CoV-2 infection mechanism and the proposal of novel and original agents to inhibit the viral key functioning. This Review deals with the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, including the mode of action that this structural protein uses to entry human cells, as well as with nonstructural viral proteins, focusing the attention on the most studied proteases and also proposing alternative mechanisms involving some of its domains, such as the SARS unique domain. We demonstrate that molecular modeling and simulation represent an effective approach to gather information on key biological processes and thus guide rational molecular design strategies.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Abstract{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The recent global pandemic caused by the new coronavirus SARS-CoV-2 presents an urgent need for new therapeutic candidates. While the importance of traditional \textit{in silico} approaches such as QSAR in such efforts in unquestionable, these models fundamentally rely on structural similarity to infer biological activity and are thus prone to becoming trapped in the very nearby chemical spaces of already known ligands. For novel and unprecedented threats such as COVID-19 much faster and efficient paradigms must be devised to accelerate the identification of new chemical classes for rapid drug development. Here we report the development of a new biological activity-based modeling (BABM) approach that builds on the hypothesis that compounds with similar activity patterns tend to share similar targets or mechanisms of action. In BABM, compound activity profiles established on massive scale across multiple assays are used as signatures to predict compound activity in a new assay or against a new target. We first trained and validated this approach by identifying new antiviral lead candidates for Zika and Ebola based on data from {\textasciitilde}0.5 million compounds screened against {\textasciitilde}2,000 assays. BABM models were then applied to predict {\textasciitilde}300 compounds not previously reported to have activity for SARS-CoV-2, which were then tested in a live virus assay with high (\&gt;30\%) hit rates. The most potent compounds showed antiviral activities in the nanomolar range. These potent confirmed compounds have the potential to be further developed in novel chemical space into new anti-SARS-CoV-2 therapies. These results demonstrate unprecedented ability using BABM to predict novel structures as chemical leads significantly beyond traditional methods, and its application in rapid drug discovery response in a global public health crisis.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {Influenza viruses annually kill 290,000–650,000 people worldwide. Antivirals can reduce death tolls. Baloxavir, the recently approved influenza antiviral, inhibits initiation of viral mRNA synthesis, whereas oseltamivir, an older drug, inhibits release of virus progeny. Baloxavir blocks virus replication more rapidly and completely than oseltamivir, reducing the duration of infectiousness. Hence, early baloxavir treatment may indirectly prevent transmission. Here, we estimate impacts of ramping up and accelerating baloxavir treatment on population-level incidence using a new model that links viral load dynamics from clinical trial data to between-host transmission. We estimate that {\textasciitilde}22 million infections and {\textgreater}6,000 deaths would have been averted in the 2017–2018 epidemic season by administering baloxavir to 30\% of infected cases within 48 h after symptom onset. Treatment within 24 h would almost double the impact. Consequently, scaling up early baloxavir treatment would substantially reduce influenza morbidity and mortality every year. The development of antivirals against the SARS-CoV2 virus that function like baloxavir might similarly curtail transmission and save lives.},

We developed mathematical models to project multiple therapeutic approaches. Our models recapitulate off-treatment viral dynamics and predict a three-phase immune response. Simulated treatment with remdesivir, selinexor, neutralizing antibodies or cellular immunotherapy demonstrates that rapid viral elimination is possible if in vivo potency is sufficiently high. Therapies dosed soon after peak viral load when symptoms develop, may decrease shedding duration and immune response intensity, but have little effect on viral area under the curve (AUC), which is driven by high early viral loads. Potent therapy dosed prior to viral peak during pre-symptomatic infection, could lower AUC. Drug resistance may emerge with a moderately potent agent dosed before viral peak. Our results support early treatment for COVID-19 if shedding duration and not AUC is most predictive of clinical severity.},

SARS-CoV-2 is efficiently transmitted from person to person and, in 2 months, has caused more than 82 000 laboratory-confirmed cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) and 2800 deaths in 46 countries. The total number of cases and deaths has surpassed that of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Although both COVID-19 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) manifest as pneumonia, COVID-19 is associated with apparently more efficient transmission, fewer cases of diarrhoea, increased mental confusion, and a lower crude fatality rate. However, the underlying virus–host interactive characteristics conferring these observations on transmissibility and clinical manifestations of COVID-19 remain unknown.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}Methods{\textless}/h3{\textgreater}{\textless}p{\textgreater}We systematically investigated the cellular susceptibility, species tropism, replication kinetics, and cell damage of SARS-CoV-2 and compared findings with those for SARS-CoV.

	abstract = {Most mucosal surfaces are lined by a single layer of epithelial cells that mediate transport. These cells also form a physical barrier that prevents pathogens, toxins, and other unwanted materials from entering the body. The paracellular space between adjacent epithelial cells is sealed by the selectively permeable tight junction. Regulation of tight junction permeability is essential for physiologic and pathologic transport in the intestinal epithelium, and loss of barrier function has been implicated in the pathogenesis of immune-mediated diseases. However, it remains unclear as to whether loss of barrier function is a precursor to disease development or results from a local inflammatory response. Using the intestinal epithelium as an example, this chapter explores the regulation of epithelial barrier function in physiological and pathophysiological conditions and the intersection between intestinal paracellular permeability and mucosal immunity.},

One uninfected gland of each of eight midlactation cows was challenged with only 30 CFU of E. coli McDonald strain 487, a serum-resistant isolate from a cow with mastitis. Bacteria grew logarithmically during the first 10 to 12 h after challenge, reaching concentrations of more than 10(5) CFU/ml with no detectable host response during this time. An intense inflammatory reaction began approximately 12 h after the challenge and was characterized by a breakdown in the blood-milk permeability barrier followed by pyrexia and a pronounced leukocytic influx. Coincident with the onset of mammary inflammation was the appearance of neutrophil chemotactic activity in the milk from infected glands. Factors able to upregulate CD18 expression on peripheral blood neutrophils also appeared in milk at this time. The lack of appearance of chemotactic and CD18-upregulating activities until 12 h after challenge indicated that delays in neutrophil recruitment resulted from an initial lack of bacterial recognition and inflammatory mediator production. Production of complement fragment C5a, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) occurred earlier than production of IL-6 or IL-8. The early and intense production of C5a indicates that this chemoattractant may be more important than IL-8 during the initial recruitment and activation of neutrophils to a developing E. coli infection.},

	abstract = {According to the World Health Organization (WHO), viral diseases continue to emerge and represent a serious issue to public health. In the last twenty years, several viral epidemics such as the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) from 2002 to 2003, and H1N1 influenza in 2009, have been recorded. Most recently, the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first identified in Saudi Arabia in 2012. In a timeline that reaches the present day, an epidemic of cases with unexplained low respiratory infections detected in Wuhan, the largest metropolitan area in China's Hubei province, was first reported to the WHO Country Office in China, on December 31, 2019. Published literature can trace the beginning of symptomatic individuals back to the beginning of December 2019. As they were unable to identify the causative agent, these first cases (n=29) were classified as "pneumonia of unknown etiology." The Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and local CDCs organized an intensive outbreak investigation program. The etiology of this illness was attributed to a novel virus belonging to the coronavirus (CoV) family. On February 11, 2020, the WHO Director-General, Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, announced that the disease caused by this new CoV was a "COVID-19," which is the acronym of "coronavirus disease 2019". In the past twenty years, two additional CoVs epidemics have occurred. SARS-CoV provoked a large-scale epidemic beginning in China and involving two dozen countries with approximately 8000 cases and 800 deaths (fatality rate of 9,6\%)[1], and the MERS-CoV that began in Saudi Arabia and has approximately 2,500 cases and 800 deaths (fatality rate of 35\%) and still causes as sporadic cases[2]. This new virus is very contagious and has quickly spread globally. In a meeting on January 30, 2020, per the International Health Regulations (IHR, 2005), the outbreak was declared by the WHO a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) as it had spread to 18 countries with four countries reporting human-to-human transmission. An additional landmark occurred on February 26, 2020, as the first case of the disease, not imported from China, was recorded in the United States (US).  Initially, the new virus was called 2019-nCoV. Subsequently, the task of experts of the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) termed it the SARS-CoV-2 virus as it is very similar to the one that caused the SARS outbreak (SARS-CoVs).  The CoVs have become the major pathogens of emerging respiratory disease outbreaks. They are a large family of single-stranded RNA viruses (+ssRNA) that can be isolated in different animal species.[3] For reasons yet to be explained, these viruses can cross species barriers and can cause, in humans, illness ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as MERS and SARS. Interestingly, these latter viruses have probably originated from bats and then moving into other mammalian hosts — the Himalayan palm civet for SARS-CoV, and the dromedary camel for MERS-CoV — before jumping to humans. The dynamics of SARS-Cov-2 are currently unknown, but there is speculation that it also has an animal origin. The potential for these viruses to grow to become a pandemic worldwide represents a serious public health risk. Concerning COVID-19, the WHO raised the threat to the CoV epidemic to the "very high" level, on February 28, 2020. On March 11, as the number of COVID-19 cases outside China has increased 13 times and the number of countries involved has tripled with more than 118,000 cases in 114 countries and over 4,000 deaths, WHO declared the COVID-19 a pandemic. World governments are at work to establish countermeasures to stem the devastating effects and it has been estimated that strict shutdowns may have saved 3 million lives across 11 European countries[4]. Health organizations coordinate information flows and issues directives and guidelines to best mitigate the impact of the threat. At the same time, scientists around the world work tirelessly, and information about the transmission mechanisms, the clinical spectrum of disease, new diagnostics, and prevention and therapeutic strategies are rapidly developing. Many uncertainties remain with regard to both the virus-host interaction and the evolution of the pandemic, with specific reference to the times when it will reach its peak. At the moment, the therapeutic strategies to deal with the infection are only supportive, and prevention aimed at reducing transmission in the community is our best weapon. Aggressive isolation measures in China have led to a progressive reduction of cases. From China, the disease spread to Europe. In Italy, in geographic regions of the north, initially, and subsequently throughout the peninsula, political and health authorities have made incredible efforts to contain a shock wave that has severely tested the health system. Afterward, the COVID-19 quickly crossed the ocean and as of June 20, 2020, about 2,282,000 cases (with 121,000 deaths) have been recorded in the US, whereas Brazil with more than 1,000,000 cases and about 50,000 deaths is the most affected state in South America and the second in the world after the US. Although over time the lethality rate (total number of deaths for a given disease in relation to the total number of patients) of COVID-19 has been significantly lower than that of the SARS and MERS epidemics, the transmission of the SARS-CoV-2 virus is much larger than that of the previous viruses, with a much higher total number of deaths. It has been estimated that about one in five individuals worldwide could be at increased risk of severe COVID-19 disease if they become infected, due to underlying health conditions[5]. In the midst of the crisis, the authors have chosen to use the "Statpearls" platform because, within the PubMed scenario, it represents a unique tool that may allow them to make updates in real-time. The aim, therefore, is to collect information and scientific evidence and to provide an overview of the topic that will be continuously updated.},

This chapter summarizes the current knowledge of the entry pathway and the role of the fusion protein of influenza virus, hemagglutinin, in this process. Hemagglutinin (HA) is a trimeric glycoprotein that is present in multiple copies in the membrane envelope of influenza virus. HA contains a fusion peptide, a receptor binding site, a metastable structural motif, and the transmembrane domain. The first step of influenza virus entry is the recognition of the host cell receptor molecule, terminal α-sialic acid, by HA. This multivalent attachment by multiple copies of trimetric HA triggers endocytosis of influenza virus that is contained in the endosome. The endosome-trapped virus traffics via a unidirectional pathway to near the nucleus. At this location, the interior pH of the endosome becomes acidic that induces a dramatic conformational change in HA to insert the fusion peptide into the host membrane, induce juxtaposition of the two membranes, and form a fusion pore that allows the release of the genome segments of influenza virus. HA plays a key role in the entire entry pathway. Inhibitors of virus entry are potentially effective antiviral drugs of influenza viruses.},

	abstract = {An outbreak of pneumonia caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) that started in Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 has become a global pandemic. Both SARS-CoV-2 and SARS-CoV enter host cells via the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor, which is expressed in various human organs. We have reviewed previously published studies on SARS and recent studies on SARS-CoV-2 infection, named coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization (WHO), confirming that many other organs besides the lungs are vulnerable to the virus. ACE2 catalyzes angiotensin II conversion to angiotensin-(1–7), and the ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS axis counteracts the negative effects of the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), which plays important roles in maintaining the physiological and pathophysiological balance of the body. In addition to the direct viral effects and inflammatory and immune factors associated with COVID-19 pathogenesis, ACE2 downregulation and the imbalance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS after infection may also contribute to multiple organ injury in COVID-19. The SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein, which binds to ACE2, is a potential target for developing specific drugs, antibodies, and vaccines. Restoring the balance between the RAS and ACE2/angiotensin-(1–7)/MAS may help attenuate organ injuries.},

Remdesivir (RDV) is an investigational compound with a broad spectrum of antiviral activities against RNA viruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome–CoV and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS–CoV). RDV is a nucleotide analog inhibitor of RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRps). Here, we co-expressed the MERS–CoV nonstructural proteins nsp5, nsp7, nsp8, and nsp12 (RdRp) in insect cells as a part a polyprotein to study the mechanism of inhibition of MERS–CoV RdRp by RDV. We initially demonstrated that nsp8 and nsp12 form an active complex. The triphosphate form of the inhibitor (RDV-TP) competes with its natural counterpart ATP. Of note, the selectivity value for RDV-TP obtained here with a steady-state approach suggests that it is more efficiently incorporated than ATP and two other nucleotide analogs. Once incorporated at position i, the inhibitor caused RNA synthesis arrest at position i + 3. Hence, the likely mechanism of action is delayed RNA chain termination. The additional three nucleotides may protect the inhibitor from excision by the viral 3′–5′​【1.5 m】 exonuclease activity. Together, these results help to explain the high potency of RDV against RNA viruses in cell-based assays.},

The host protease furin cleaves the full-length precursor S glycoprotein into two associated polypeptides: S1 and S2. Cleavage of S generates a polybasic Arg-Arg-Ala-Arg C-terminal sequence on S1, which conforms to a C-end rule (CendR) motif that binds to cell surface Neuropilin-1 (NRP1) and Neuropilin-2 (NRP2) receptors. Here, we used X-ray crystallography and biochemical approaches to show that the S1 CendR motif directly bound NRP1.

	abstract = {COVID-19, caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2 virus, started in China in late 2019, and soon became a global pandemic. With the help of thousands of viral genome sequences that have been accumulating, it has become possible to track the evolution of the viral genome over time as it spread across the world. An important question that still needs to be answered is whether any of the common mutations affect the viral properties, and therefore the disease characteristics. Therefore, we sought to understand the effects of mutations in RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), particularly the common 14408C{\textgreater}T mutation, on mutation rate and viral spread. By focusing on mutations in the slowly evolving M or E genes, we aimed to minimize the effects of selective pressure. Our results indicate that 14408C{\textgreater}T mutation increases the mutation rate, while the third-most common RdRp mutation, 15324C{\textgreater}T, has the opposite effect. It is possible that 14408C{\textgreater}T mutation may have contributed to the dominance of its co-mutations in Europe and elsewhere.},

This is most efficiently achieved using representative animal models of primary infection including in the background of chronic disease with validation of findings in primary human cells and tissues.

We demonstrate that REGN-COV-2 can greatly reduce virus load in lower and upper airways and decrease virus induced pathological sequelae when administered prophylactically or therapeutically in rhesus macaques. Similarly, administration in hamsters limits weight loss and decreases lung titers and evidence of pneumonia in the lungs.

Following an unprecedented global spread3, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic on 11 March 2020. Although data on COVID-19 in humans are emerging at a steady pace, some aspects of the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 can be studied in detail only in animal models, in which repeated sampling and tissue collection is possible. Here we show that SARS-CoV-2 causes a respiratory disease in rhesus macaques that lasts between 8 and 16 days. Pulmonary infiltrates, which are a hallmark of COVID-19 in humans, were visible in lung radiographs. We detected high viral loads in swabs from the nose and throat of all of the macaques, as well as in bronchoalveolar lavages; in one macaque, we observed prolonged rectal shedding. Together, the rhesus macaque recapitulates the moderate disease that has been observed in the majority of human cases of COVID-19. The establishment of the rhesus macaque as a model of COVID-19 will increase our understanding of the pathogenesis of this disease, and aid in the development and testing of medical countermeasures.},

	abstract = {Helper T (Th) cells are a crucial component of the adaptive immune system and are of fundamental importance in orchestrating the appropriate response to pathogenic challenge. They fall into two broad categories defined by the cytokines each produces. Th1 cells produce interferon- γ and are required for effective immunity to intracellular bacteria, viruses and protozoa whereas Th2 produce IL-4 and are required for optimal antibody production to T-dependent antigens. A great deal of experimental data on the regulation of Th1 and Th2 differentiation have been obtained but many essential features of this complex system are still not understood. Here we present a mathematical model of Th1/Th2 differentiation and cross regulation. We model Fas-mediated activation-induced cell death (AICD) as this process has been identified as an important mechanism for limiting clonal expansion and resolving T cell responses. We conclude that Th2 susceptibility to AICD is important for stabilizing the two polarized arms of the T helper response, and that cell–cell killing, not suicide, is the dominant mechanism for Fas-mediated death of Th1 effectors. We find that the combination of the anti-proliferative effect of the cytokine TGF- β and the inhibiting influence of IL-10 on T cell activation are crucial controls for Th2 populations. We see that the strengths of the activation signals for each T helper cell subset, which are dependent on the antigen dose, co-stimulatory signals and the cytokine environment, critically determine the dominant helper subset. Switches from Th1- to Th2-dominance may be important in chronic infection and we show that this phenomenon can arise from differential AICD susceptibility of T helper subsets, and asymmetries in the nature of the cross-suppressive cytokine interactions. Our model suggests that in some senses a predominantly type 2 reaction may well be the “default” pathway for an antigen-specific immune response, due to these asymmetries.},

	abstract = {Clinical question What is the role of remdesivir in the treatment of severe covid-19? This guideline was triggered by the ACTT-1 trial published in the New England Journal of Medicine on 22 May 2020.
Current practice Remdesivir has received worldwide attention as a potentially effective treatment for severe covid-19. After rapid market approval in the US, remdesivir is already being used in clinical practice.
Recommendations The guideline panel makes a weak recommendation for the use of remdesivir in severe covid-19 while recommending continuation of active enrolment of patients into ongoing randomised controlled trials examining remdesivir.
How this guideline was created An international panel of patients, clinicians, and methodologists produced these recommendations in adherence with standards for trustworthy guidelines using the GRADE approach. The recommendations are based on a linked systematic review and network meta-analysis. The panel considered an individual patient perspective and allowed contextual factors (such as resources) to be taken into account for countries and healthcare systems.
The evidence The linked systematic review (published 31 Jul 2020) identified two randomised trials with 1300 participants, showing low certainty evidence that remdesivir may be effective in reducing time to clinical improvement and may decrease mortality in patients with severe covid-19. Remdesivir probably has no important effect on need for invasive mechanical ventilation. Remdesivir may have little or no effect on hospital length of stay.
Understanding the recommendation Most patients with severe covid-19 would likely choose treatment with remdesivir given the potential reduction in time to clinical improvement. However, given the low certainty evidence for critical outcomes and the fact that different perspectives, values, and preferences may alter decisions regarding remdesivir, the panel issued a weak recommendation with strong support for continued recruitment in randomised trials.},

With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 mM). Weaker activity is observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 mM) because of their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efﬁcacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with the chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminishes lung viral load and improves pulmonary function compared with vehicle-treated animals. These data demonstrate that RDV is potently active against SARSCoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}BACKGROUND WHO expert groups recommended mortality trials in hospitalized COVID-19 of four re-purposed antiviral drugs. METHODS Study drugs were Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir (fixed-dose combination with Ritonavir) and Interferon-β1a (mainly subcutaneous; initially with Lopinavir, later not). COVID-19 inpatients were randomized equally between whichever study drugs were locally available and open control (up to 5 options: 4 active and local standard-of-care). The intent-to-treat primary analyses are of in-hospital mortality in the 4 pairwise comparisons of each study drug vs its controls (concurrently allocated the same management without that drug, despite availability). Kaplan-Meier 28-day risks are unstratified; log-rank death rate ratios (RRs) are stratified for age and ventilation at entry. RESULTS In 405 hospitals in 30 countries 11,266 adults were randomized, with 2750 allocated Remdesivir, 954 Hydroxychloroquine, 1411 Lopinavir, 651 Interferon plus Lopinavir, 1412 only Interferon, and 4088 no study drug. Compliance was 94-96\% midway through treatment, with 2-6\% crossover. 1253 deaths were reported (at median day 8, IQR 4-14). Kaplan-Meier 28-day mortality was 12\% (39\% if already ventilated at randomization, 10\% otherwise). Death rate ratios (with 95\% CIs and numbers dead/randomized, each drug vs its control) were: Remdesivir RR=0.95 (0.81-1.11, p=0.50; 301/2743 active vs 303/2708 control), Hydroxychloroquine RR=1.19 (0.89-1.59, p=0.23; 104/947 vs 84/906), Lopinavir RR=1.00 (0.79-1.25, p=0.97; 148/1399 vs 146/1372) and Interferon RR=1.16 (0.96-1.39, p=0.11; 243/2050 vs 216/2050). No study drug definitely reduced mortality (in unventilated patients or any other subgroup of entry characteristics), initiation of ventilation or hospitalisation duration. CONCLUSIONS These Remdesivir, Hydroxychloroquine, Lopinavir and Interferon regimens appeared to have little or no effect on hospitalized COVID-19, as indicated by overall mortality, initiation of ventilation and duration of hospital stay. The mortality findings contain most of the randomized evidence on Remdesivir and Interferon, and are consistent with meta-analyses of mortality in all major trials. (Funding: WHO.

With no approved therapies, this pandemic illustrates the urgent need for broad-spectrum antiviral countermeasures against SARS-CoV-2 and future emerging CoVs. We report that remdesivir (RDV) potently inhibits SARS-CoV-2 replication in human lung cells and primary human airway epithelial cultures (EC50 = 0.01 μM). Weaker activity is observed in Vero E6 cells (EC50 = 1.65 μM) because of their low capacity to metabolize RDV. To rapidly evaluate in vivo efficacy, we engineered a chimeric SARS-CoV encoding the viral target of RDV, the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase of SARS-CoV-2. In mice infected with the chimeric virus, therapeutic RDV administration diminishes lung viral load and improves pulmonary function compared with vehicle-treated animals. These data demonstrate that RDV is potently active against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro and in vivo, supporting its further clinical testing for treatment of COVID-19.,

In rhesus macaques, early initiation of remdesivir therapy prevented pneumonia and lowered viral loads in the lung, but viral loads increased in the nasal passages five days after therapy. We developed mathematical models to explain these results. We identified that 1) drug potency is slightly higher in nasal passages than in lungs, 2) viral load decrease in lungs relative to nasal passages during therapy because of infection-dependent generation of refractory cells in the lung, 3) incomplete drug potency in the lung that decreases viral loads even slightly may allow substantially less lung damage, and 4) increases in nasal viral load may occur due to a slight blunting of peak viral load and subsequent decrease of the intensity of the innate immune response, as well as a lack of refractory cells. We also hypothesize that direct inoculation of the trachea in rhesus macaques may not recapitulate natural infection as lung damage occurs more abruptly in this model than in human infection. We demonstrate with sensitivity analysis that a drug with higher potency could completely suppress viral replication and lower viral loads abruptly in the nasal passages as well as the lung.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}One Sentence Summary{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}We developed a mathematical model to explain why remdesivir has a greater antiviral effect on SARS CoV-2 in lung versus nasal passages in rhesus macaques.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}Masks are a vital tool for limiting SARS-CoV-2 spread in the population. Here we utilize a mathematical model to assess the impact of masking on transmission within individual transmission pairs and at the population level. Our model quantitatively links mask efficacy to reductions in viral load and subsequent transmission risk. Our results reinforce that the use of masks by both a potential transmitter and exposed person substantially reduces the probability of successful transmission, even if masks only lower exposure viral load by {\textasciitilde}50\%. Slight increases in mask adherence and/or efficacy above current levels would reduce the effective reproductive number (Re) substantially below 1, particularly if implemented comprehensively in potential super-spreader environments. Our model predicts that moderately efficacious masks will lower exposure viral load 10-fold among people who get infected despite masking, potentially limiting infection severity. Because peak viral load tends to occur pre-symptomatically, we also identify that antiviral therapy targeting symptomatic individuals is unlikely to impact transmission risk. Instead, antiviral therapy would only lower Re if dosed as post-exposure prophylaxis and if given to {\textasciitilde}50\% of newly infected people within 3 days of an exposure. These results highlight the primacy of masking relative to other biomedical interventions under consideration for limiting the extent of the COVID-19 pandemic prior to widespread implementation of a vaccine.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {{\textless}p{\textgreater}SARS-CoV-2 is difficult to contain because many transmissions occur during the pre-symptomatic phase of infection. Moreover, in contrast to influenza, while most SARS-CoV-2 infected people do not transmit the virus to anybody, a small percentage secondarily infect large numbers of people. We designed mathematical models of SARS-CoV-2 and influenza which link observed viral shedding patterns with key epidemiologic features of each virus, including distributions of the number of secondary cases attributed to each infected person (individual R0) and the duration between symptom onset in the transmitter and secondarily infected person (serial interval). We identify that people with SARS-CoV-2 or influenza infections are usually contagious for fewer than one day congruent with peak viral load several days after infection, and that transmission is unlikely below a certain viral load. SARS-CoV-2 super-spreader events with over 10 secondary infections occur when an infected person is briefly shedding at a very high viral load and has a high concurrent number of exposed contacts. The higher predisposition of SARS-CoV-2 towards super-spreading events is not due to its 1-2 additional weeks of viral shedding relative to influenza. Rather, a person infected with SARS-CoV-2 exposes more people within equivalent physical contact networks than a person infected with influenza, likely due to aerosolization of virus. Our results support policies that limit crowd size in indoor spaces and provide viral load benchmarks for infection control and therapeutic interventions intended to prevent secondary transmission.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

This report describes two phase I studies that evaluated the safety and pharmacokinetics (PKs) of single escalating and multiple i.v. doses of RDV (solution or lyophilized formulation) in healthy subjects. Lyophilized formulation was evaluated for potential future use in clinical trials due to its storage stability in resource-limited settings. All adverse events were grade 1 or 2 in severity. Overall, RDV exhibited a linear profile following single-dose i.v. administration over 2 hours of RDV solution formulation across the dose range of 3–225 mg. Both lyophilized and solution formulations provided comparable PK parameters. High intracellular concentrations of the active triphosphate ( 220-fold to 370-fold higher than the in vitro half-maximal effective concentration against SARS-CoV-2 clinical isolate) were achieved following infusion of 75 mg or 150 mg lyophilized formulation over 30 minutes or 2 hours. Following multiple-doses of RDV 150 mg once daily for 7 or 14 days, RDV exhibited a PK profile similar to single-dose administration. Metabolite GS-441524 accumulated 1.9-fold after daily dosing.

Here, we established the dynamical connections between viral loads, infected cells, CD8$^{\textrm{+}}$ T cells, lung injury, and disease severity using an integrative model-experiment exchange. The model predicts that infection resolution is sensitive to CD8 expansion, that there is a critical T cell magnitude needed for efficient resolution, and that the rate of T cell-mediated clearance is dependent on infected cell density. We used whole lung histomorphometry to validate the model, which showed that the infected area matched the model-predicted infected cell dynamics, and that the resolved area paralleled the relative CD8 dynamics. Additional analysis revealed a nonlinear relation between disease severity (i.e., weight loss) and lung injury. These novel links between important pathogen kinetics and host pathology enhance our ability to forecast disease progression, potential complications, and therapeutic efficacy.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {The present project aims to use machine learning, specifically neural networks (NN), to learn the trajectories of a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and decrease compute times for obtaining ODE solutions by using this surragate model. As an example system of proven biological significance, we use an ODE model of a gene regulatory circuit of cyanobacteria related to photosynthesis {\textbackslash}cite\{original\_biology\_Kehoe, Sundus\_math\_model\}. Using data generated by a numeric solution to the exemplar system, we train several long-short-term memory neural networks. We stopping training when the networks achieve an accuracy of of 3{\textbackslash}\% on testing data resulting in networks able to predict values in the ODE time series ranging from 0.25 minutes to 6.25 minutes beyond input values. We observed computational speed ups ranging from 9.75 to 197 times when comparing prediction compute time with compute time for obtaining the numeric solution. Given the success of this proof of concept, we plan on continuing this project in the future and will attempt to realize the same computational speed-ups in the context of an agent-based modeling platfom.},

However, the transition region between them still lacks explanation. In this work we will investigate, through three-dimensional computational simulations, the surfactant’s influence on the evolution of a foam when its liquid fraction is intermediate. The computational simulations will be done in the computational environment Compucell3D, which is based on the Celular Potts Model, a generalization of the Potts model. Part of the investigation will be about characteristics of Celular Potts Model. Namely, what are the degrees of freedom of systems that use this model and how the system’s energy changes with the cells’ target volume.},

	abstract = {Generation of inflammatory mediators and leukocyte recruitment to infection at an epithelial surface were studied during Escherichia coli-induced mastitis. One uninfected gland of each of eight midlactation cows was challenged with only 30 CFU of E. coli McDonald strain 487, a serum-resistant isolate from a cow with mastitis. Bacteria grew logarithmically during the first 10 to 12 h after challenge, reaching concentrations of more than 10(5) CFU/ml with no detectable host response during this time. An intense inflammatory reaction began approximately 12 h after the challenge and was characterized by a breakdown in the blood-milk permeability barrier followed by pyrexia and a pronounced leukocytic influx. Coincident with the onset of mammary inflammation was the appearance of neutrophil chemotactic activity in the milk from infected glands. Factors able to upregulate CD18 expression on peripheral blood neutrophils also appeared in milk at this time. The lack of appearance of chemotactic and CD18-upregulating activities until 12 h after challenge indicated that delays in neutrophil recruitment resulted from an initial lack of bacterial recognition and inflammatory mediator production. Production of complement fragment C5a, tumor necrosis factor, and interleukin-1 (IL-1) occurred earlier than production of IL-6 or IL-8. The early and intense production of C5a indicates that this chemoattractant may be more important than IL-8 during the initial recruitment and activation of neutrophils to a developing E. coli infection.},
