I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude and heartfelt appreciation to each and every one of you who has supported and guided me throughout my doctoral journey. Your contributions have been invaluable, and I am immensely grateful for your presence in my life.

I am immensely grateful to my supervisor, James, for your unwavering support, expertise, and encouragement. Your guidance, intellectual insights, kind words and stern words, have been paramount in pushing me through the PhD and making my research readable and good. Your commitment to excellence have been instrumental in shaping the direction of my research and helping me grow as a researcher. I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation to the members of my academic committee, Maria, Greg, and Vikram. Your valuable feedback, constructive criticism, and insightful suggestions have significantly enriched my research and contributed to the overall quality of my work. 

To my "in the trenches" coworkers, TJ, Josh, Priyom, and Joel, thank you for all the conversations. For helping navigate the PhD itself, the research, how to present and talk about ideas. You've made things infinitely better than they would have been without you. 

To my fellow researchers and colleagues, both within and outside IUB, I want to thank you for sharing your knowledge, ideas, and experiences with me. The stimulating discussions, collaborative efforts, and mutual support we have shared have been instrumental in shaping my research and broadening my perspectives. Your friendship and camaraderie have made this journey all the more rewarding.


To my wife, Camila, you got me through the bad times, and are the best companion for the good times. I want to express my deepest gratitude and love. Your unwavering support, understanding, and patience have been the rock upon which I built my academic journey. You have been there for me through every triumph and challenge, providing me with boundless encouragement, and believing in me even when I doubted myself. Your constant presence, love, and sacrifices have been the driving force behind my success. Thank you for being my pillar of strength and for standing by my side throughout this demanding journey.

To my Mom, Dad, thank you for the sacrifices you've made, the journey you took during your life. Without you I wouldn't be the person I am. I woun't have been able to do physics at UFRGS, I wouldn't have gone to TCD for a year abroad, I wouldn't have done a PhD. To my Brother, Grandparents, Aunts and Uncles, and Cousins, to my whole family, thank you for being there even from afar. Its not easy, and I miss you dearly. Your encouragement, patience, and belief in my abilities have been my constant source of motivation. I am forever grateful for your presence in my life. 


I'd like to thank Rebecca Winkle for all the help with registering with ISE and all the other initial bureaucracies of grad school as well as her kindness = during the process, similarly, and not less importantly, I'd like to thank Josh Wayne for helping navigate the final bureaucracies, his pro-activeness, kindness and quick replies were fundamental to keep my anxiety in check!

I want to thank the Indiana Graduate Workers Coalition for improving working conditions for us. For fighting against such a big and powerful organization, for giving us a voice and bringing our issues to the table with IU. Thanks to us coming together as IGWC, we've done a lot. I'm thankful to have helped in the manners I could. I'm sure IGWC's members' successes are only starting!

You have all  helped me grow not only as a researcher but also as an individual. 

Finally, I also want to thank Liang Chen for creating the \LaTeX \hspace{0.5ex}template I used to write this thesis (available at\\*\url{https://github.com/liang-chen/IU-PhD-Thesis-Template}), as well as Leslie Lamport and Donald Knuth for originating \LaTeX itself. Without their efforts writing a thesis would be impossible.
